239848:::::The I-5 Killer:::::As a young man, Randall Woodfield had it all--a star athlete, good looks, and an award-winning student. Working in the swinging West Coast bar scene, he had more than his share of women. But he wanted more than just sex. An appetite for unspeakable violent acts led him to cruise the I-5 highway through California to Washington, leaving a trail of victims along the way. As the list of the dead grew, the police mobilized to stop a twisted killer who had 44 known deaths to his name. Praise for Ann Rule: "Vivid...Extraordinary...A page-turner!"-- "New York Times Book Review," for "Small Sacrifices" "Rule has an instinct for suspense, knowing just what information to leak to the reader and when."-- "Washington Post Book World," for "Small Sacrifices" "A shattering story...carefully investigated, written with compassion but also with professional objectivity."-- "Seattle Times," for "The Stranger Beside Me"
