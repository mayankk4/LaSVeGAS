625156:::::Touching Evil:::::Sometimes evil lingers so close, you can feel it.... Seattle police sketch artist Maggie Barnes has an extraordinary gift.

To stop the escalating terror, Maggie will have to push her abilities to the breaking point -- even if it means confronting a predator whose powers seem to have no bounds....
