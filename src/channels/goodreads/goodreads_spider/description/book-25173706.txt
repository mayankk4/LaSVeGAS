25173706:::::Equating the Equations of Insanity: A Journey from Grief to Victory:::::People commit suicide not because they are in grief, but because they were unable to solve the lateral equations of insanity. The world has observed a number of acts of brutality in the form of domestic violence, sexual assault and rape. Some of the major cases in recent past were of Elizabeth Pena, Rehtaeh Parsons, Oksana Makar and Nirvaya to name a few. Some victims manage to survive but not all. They live in grief for the rest of their lives and if not they QUIT. This work is inspired from such cases where the victims have set examples by their life from grief to victory. And they can inspire you if you or someone of your near one is in grief.
