Her home life is a secret hell, and she s trying to find a way out. But everything changes when Ren says hello and sees right through to her truth. Ren Hendrick s succeed's at everything he touches, including football. But he s never been passionate about anything. He s quiet and keeps to himself, which pisses people off. But he can t find the desire to care. He s lived a life without color, until Lily walks in and lights up his world. Their story is one of sweet young love and finding your forever before you can even dream of what that is. It s one of protecting what belongs to you and having the courage to follow your heart, no matter your age. Warning: Call your dentist and schedule an appointment, because you re going to get nothing but cavities from this sugary book. Ren and Lily start off so innocent, but by the time it s over, you re gonna need to hose yourself off. We re talking two virgins who turn into maniacs. You re welcome!
