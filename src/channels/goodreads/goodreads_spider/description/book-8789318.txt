8789318:::::Deadly Little Voices:::::High school junior Camelia thought her powers of psychometry only gave her the ability to sense the future through touch. But now she s started to hear voices. Mean voices. Berating her, telling her how ugly she is, and that she d be better off dead. It s a troubling development that has Camelia terrified for her mental stability, especially since her deranged aunt with a suicidal history just moved into the family house. More torturing, ex-boyfriend Ben, who has similar psychometric abilities, has been spending more time with their classmate Alejandra, even as her own feelings for Adam grow stronger. Still, the bond between Camelia and Ben is palpable. With the line between right and wrong fraying, Camelia turns to pottery to get a grasp on her emotions. She begins sculpting a beautiful figure skater, only to receive frightening premonitions that someone s in danger. But who is the victim? And how can Camelia help them when she is on the brink of losing her own sanity?
