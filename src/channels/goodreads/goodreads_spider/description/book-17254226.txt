17254226:::::Fear of Falling:::::I can t remember the last time I felt completely safe. Security seemed more like a luxury to me, reserved for those who were fortunate enough to have picture perfect childhoods. For those who didn t bear the ugly scars that keep me bound in constant, debilitating fear. I ve run from that fear my entire life. But when I met him, for once, I couldn t run anymore. He scared the hell out of me in a way that excited every fiber of my being. It wasn t the tattoos or the piercings. It wasn t the warmth that seemed to radiate from his frame and blanket me whenever he was near. It was just him. The scary beautiful man that threatened to alter 23 years of routine and rituals, and make me face my crippling fear. My name is Kami and I am constantly afraid. And the thing that scares me the most is the very thing I want. Don t worry, he smiled, pulling me into the hard warmth of his chest. I ve got you. I ll always catch you when you fall. And just like that, Blaine had staked his claim on the untouched part of me that no living soul had ever moved. He had captured every fear, every reservation, and crushed them in the palm of his inked hand. Author Disclaimer: Abuse is real- verbal, emotional, physical and sexual.
