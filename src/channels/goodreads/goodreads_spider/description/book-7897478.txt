7897478:::::The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee:::::From the outrageously filthy and oddly innocent comedienne Sarah Silverman comes a memoir her first book that is at once shockingly personal, surprisingly poignant, and still pee-in-your-pants funny. If you like Sarah s television show The Sarah Silverman Program, or memoirs such as Chelsea Handler s Are You There Vodka? It s Me Chelsea and Artie Lange s Too Fat to Fish, you ll love The Bedwetter.
