431178:::::Say Goodnight, Gracie:::::There are friends we can't imagine living without. Morgan and Jimmy were kids together, whirling around the porch on hot summer days. They've been friends forever, and by now they know each other inside out. They do everything together--from cutting high school to go into the city to coaching each other at dance auditions and acting workshops. They even argue well. A perfect friendship. Best friends. For life. So how could life be so right and then be so wrong? After a terrible accident, Morgan suddenly has to face life alone. Without Jimmy around, though, it's like the best part of her has died. How could he do this to her? And why is love so hard? 1989 Recommended Books for Reluctant Young Adult Readers (ALA) 1988 Young Adult Editors' Choices (BL) Young Adult Choices for 1990 (IRA) Children's Books of 1988 (Library of Congress) 1988 Books for the Teen Age (NY Public Library)
