17237477:::::The Tied Man:::::Lilith Bresson, an independent, successful young artist, is forced to travel from her home in Spain to the wild borderlands of northern England, to repay her feckless father s latest debt by painting a portrait of the enigmatic Lady Blaine Albermarle. On her first night at Albermarle Hall she meets Finn Strachan, Blaine s companion , a cultured and hauntingly beautiful young man who seems to have it all. But Lilith has an artist s eye, and a gift for seeing what lies beneath the skin. She soon discovers that Blaine is more gaoler than lover, and if the price is right, depravity has no limits. As the weeks pass, Lilith finds that she too is drawn into the malign web that her patron has spun, yet against the odds she forges a strong friendship with the damaged, dysfunctional Finn. In a dark, modern twist to an age-old story, Lilith Bresson proves that sometimes it s the princess who needs to become the rescuer. Please note that this storyline contains depictions of drug abuse, violence and non-consensual sexual activity.
