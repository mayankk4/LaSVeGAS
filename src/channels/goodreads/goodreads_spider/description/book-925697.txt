925697:::::More-With-Less Cookbook:::::When first published in 1976, More-with-Less Cookbook by Doris Janzen Longacre struck a nerve with its call for every household to help solve the world food crisis. Now with more than 850,000 copies around the globe, it has become the favorite cookbook of many families. Full of recipes from hundreds of contributors, More-with-Less Cookbook offers suggestions "on how to eat better and consume less of the world's limited food resources." While not including new recipes, this most recent printing does include a new introduction and updated statistics with food costs and nutritional information for today's generations.
