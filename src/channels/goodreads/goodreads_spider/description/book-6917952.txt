6917952:::::Burned:::::WHEN FRIENDS STOP TRUSTING EACH OTHER, DARKNESS IS THERE TO FAN THE FLAMES... THINGS HAVE TURNED BLACK AT THE HOUSE OF NIGHT. ZOEY REDBIRD'S SOUL HAS SHATTERED. With a broken heart making her want to stay in the Otherworld forever, she's fading fast. As the only living person who can reach her, Stark must find a way to save her. But how? He will have to die to do so, the Vampyre High Council stipulates. And then Zoey will give up for sure. There are only seven days left... Enter BFF Stevie Rae. She wants to help Z, but she has massive problems, too. The rogue Red Fledgings are acting up again. Her kinda boyfriend, Dallas, is sweet but too nosy. Stevie Rae's hiding a secret that might be the key to helping Zoey, but which also threathens to explode her whole world. In the middle of the whole mess is Aphrodite: ex-Fledging, trust-fund baby, total hag from Hell (and proud of it). She's always been blessed (if you could call it that) with prophetic visions, but now it seems Nyx has decided to speak through her, whether she wants it or not. Aphrodite's loyalty can swing a lot of different ways, but right now Zoey's fate hangs in the balance. Three girls... playing with fire... if they don't watch out, everyone will get Burned.
