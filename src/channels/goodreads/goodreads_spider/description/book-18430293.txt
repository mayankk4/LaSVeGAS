18430293:::::Richard Stark's Parker: Slayground:::::Darwyn Cooke's masterful and multi award-winning series of Parker graphic novels continues with Slayground! Parker, whose getaway car crashes after a heist, manages to elude capture with his loot by breaking into an amusement park that is closed for the winter. But his presence does not go unnoticed - a pair of cops observed the job and its aftermath. But rather than pursue their suspect... they decide to go into business for themselves, with the help of some "business associates." From then on it's a game of cat and mouse, one played out through closed rides of the abandoned carnival... a game that slowly starts to favor the mouse. Includes the Eisner award-winning short story "The 7th," previously only available in the Martini edition!
