20446802:::::The Dragon Conspiracy:::::A gala opening at the Metropolitan Museum of Art has attracted the upper crust of Manhattan and thieves. A trio of vile harpies attacks the crowd and steals the stars of the exhibition: a colorful cluster of seven cursed diamonds known as the Dragon Eggs. In the right mage s hands, each stone can pack a magical wallop. Together they have the power to cure the supernaturals of the tristate area but for many of those vampires and werewolves, that means turning into dust. I m Makenna Fraser, a seer for SPI. With the help of my partner, Ian, and the other agents, I have twenty-four hours to prevent total global panic, find the diamonds, and save the supernatural community. No biggie...
