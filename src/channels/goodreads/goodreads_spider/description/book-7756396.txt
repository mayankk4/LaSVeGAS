7756396:::::Grimm's Complete Fairy Tales:::::For almost two centuries, the stories of magic and myth gathered by the Brothers Grimm have been part of the way children and adults learn about the vagaries of the real world. Cinderella, Rapunzel, Snow-White, H nsel and Gretel, Little Red-Cap (a.k.a. Little Red Riding Hood), and Briar-Rose (a.k.a. Sleeping Beauty) are only a few of more than 200 enchanting characters included here. Lyrically translated and beautifully illustrated, the tales are presented just as Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm originally set them down: bold, primal, just frightening enough, and endlessly engaging.
