17448097:::::Killer Frost:::::I ve battled the Reapers of Chaos before and survived. But this time I have a Bad, Bad Feeling it s going to be a fight to the death most likely mine. Yeah, I ve got my psychometry magic, my talking sword, Vic and even the most dangerous Spartan on campus at my side, in Logan freaking Quinn, but I m no match for Loki, the evil Norse god of chaos. I may be Nike s Champion, but at heart, I m still just Gwen Frost, that weird Gypsy girl everyone at school loves to gossip about. Then someone I love is put in more danger than ever before, and something inside me snaps. This time, Loki and his Reapers are going down for good or I am.
