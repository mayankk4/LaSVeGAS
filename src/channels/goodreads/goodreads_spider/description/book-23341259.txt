23341259:::::Violent Ends:::::In a one-of-a-kind collaboration, seventeen of the most recognizable YA writers including Shaun David Hutchinson, Neal and Brendan Shusterman, and Beth Revis come together to share the viewpoints of a group of students affected by a school shooting. It took only twenty-two minutes for Kirby Matheson to exit his car, march onto the school grounds, enter the gymnasium, and open fire, killing six and injuring five others. But this isn t a story about the shooting itself. This isn t about recounting that one unforgettable day. This is about one boy who had friends, enjoyed reading, playing saxophone in the band, and had never been in trouble before became a monster capable of entering his school with a loaded gun and firing bullets at his classmates. Each chapter is told from a different victim s viewpoint, giving insight into who Kirby was and who he d become. Some are sweet, some are dark; some are seemingly unrelated, about fights or first kisses or late-night parties. This is a book told from multiple perspectives with one character and one event drawing them all together by some of YA s most recognizable names.
