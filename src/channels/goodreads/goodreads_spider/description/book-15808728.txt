15808728:::::The Christie Curse:::::In 1926, Agatha Christie disappeared making headlines across the world only to show up eleven days later at a spa under an assumed name. During those eleven days, did she have time to write a play? Jordan Kelly needs a new job and a new place to live. She s back in Harrison Falls, New York, living with her not so law-abiding uncles, in debt thanks to a credit card stealing ex and pending grad school loans. Enter the perfect job, a research position that includes room and board, which will allow her to spend her days hunting down rare mysteries for an avid book collector. There s just one problem: her employer, Vera Van Alst the most hated citizen of Harrison Falls. Jordan s first assignment is to track down a rumored Agatha Christie play. It seems easy enough, but Jordan soon finds out that her predecessor was killed while looking for it, and there is still someone out there willing to murder to keep the play out of Vera s hands. Jordan s new job is good but is it worth her life?
