52823:::::Tartuffe:::::Condemned and banned for five years in Moli re s day, Tartuffe is a satire on religious hypocrisy. Tartuffe worms his way into Orgon s household, blinding the master of the house with his religious "devotion," and almost succeeds in his attempts to seduce his wife and disinherit his children before the final unmasking.
