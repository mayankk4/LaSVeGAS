When strange things are starting to happen in Hell, Cass knows she must protect Dallas at all costs because where Cass comes from, losing one's twin flame is a fate worse than death... Will chaos-loving Cassandra find a way to sway her immortal family in time with a revengeful killer wracking havoc in Hell in her quest to get the one thing half the paranormal world desires?
