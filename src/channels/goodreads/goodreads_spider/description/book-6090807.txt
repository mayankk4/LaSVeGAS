In Linwood Barclay s riveting new thriller, an ordinary man s desperate search for his daughter leads him into a dark world of corruption, exploitation, and murder.

She s moved in with a man whose moody son spends more time online than he should. His girlfriend is turning out to be a bit of a flake. It s not a life without hassles, but nothing will prepare Tim for the nightmare that s about to begin. Sydney vanishes into thin air. At the hotel where she supposedly worked, no one has ever heard of her. Even her closest friends seem to be at a loss. Now, as the days pass without word, Tim must face the fact that not only is Sydney missing, but that the daughter he s loved and thought he knew is a virtual stranger. As he retraces Sydney s steps, Tim discovers that the suburban Connecticut town he always thought of as idyllic is anything but. What he doesn t know is that his every move is being watched. There are others who want to find Syd as much as Tim does. But they re not planning a Welcome Home party. The closer Tim comes to the truth, the closer he comes to every parent s worst nightmare and the kind of evil only a parent s love has a chance in hell of stopping.
