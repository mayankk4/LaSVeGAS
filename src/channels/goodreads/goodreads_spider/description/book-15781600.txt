15781600:::::The Daughter of Ares Chronicles: The Complete Trilogy:::::Update: As of 2013 I took this book off publication. However, you can still get it in Verses of Athine! Why did I take it down? Made my life easier because I went in and edited all the novellas again and added the 4th one to the mix! Plus in Verses they are laid out in the order you need to read them. Book 5 in the series is in progress. If you read this prior to April 2013 with this cover then you are missing out on all the wonderful changes and editing :) Athine has long been told she was the chosen one. Only problem is she doesn't want to be chosen for anything; she wants her own adventures. She gets her chance when she learns that her new powers allow her to kill other immortals. Follow Athine from the beginning as she learns about her heritage and being an immortal born. See how she interacts with some notable immortals such as Zeus, Hera, Odin, and Morrigan. Learn about the origins of the vampire and what happened to the dragons! This edition is one that contains all three "Athine Verses" stories under one title.
