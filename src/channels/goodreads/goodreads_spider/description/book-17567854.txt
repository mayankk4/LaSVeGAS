17567854:::::Intermix Nation:::::Intermix: to mix together, blend North America, paragon of diversity, is gone. From its ashes, a new nation has arisen Renatus where the government segregates the surviving population into races, forbidding interracial marriage, mating, and love. Eighteen-year-old Nazirah Nation is a pariah, an intermix, born of people from different races. When her parents are murdered in the name of justice, Nazirah grudgingly joins the growing rebellion fighting against the despotic government. Overwhelmed with grief, consumed by guilt, Nazirah craves vengeance as a substitute for absolution. But on her journey to find the girl she once was, Nazirah must learn the hard way that nothing no one is purely black or white. Like her, every human is intermix, shades and hues of complex emotions. And those who can take everything away are also the ones who can give everything back.
