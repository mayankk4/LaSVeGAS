12700337:::::If I Should Die:::::I will not lose another person I love. I will not let history repeat itself. Vincent waited lifetimes to find me, but in an instant our future together was shattered. He was betrayed by someone we both called a friend, and I lost him. Now our enemy is determined to rule over France s immortals, and willing to wage a war to get what they want. It shouldn t be possible, none of it should be, but this is my reality. I know Vincent is somewhere out there, I know he s not completely gone, and I will do anything to save him. After what we ve already fought to achieve, a life without Vincent is unimaginable. He once swore to avoid dying to go against his nature and forsake sacrificing himself for others so that we could be together. How can I not risk everything to bring my love back to me?
