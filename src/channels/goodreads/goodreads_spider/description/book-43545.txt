43545:::::The Once and Future King:::::Once upon a time, a young boy called Wart was tutored by a magician named Merlyn in preparation for a future he couldn t possibly imagine. A future in which he would ally himself with the greatest knights, love a legendary queen and unite a country dedicated to chivalrous values. A future that would see him crowned and known for all time as Arthur, King of the Britons. During Arthur s reign, the kingdom of Camelot was founded to cast enlightenment on the Dark Ages, while the knights of the Round Table embarked on many a noble quest. But Merlyn foresaw the treachery that awaited his liege: the forbidden love between Queen Guinevere and Lancelot, the wicked plots of Arthur s half-sister Morgause, and the hatred she fostered in Mordred that would bring an end to the king s dreams for Britain--and to the king himself.
