43780:::::Vampire Chronicles: Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, The Queen of the Damned:::::The ornate, casket-like packaging and neogothic graphic design of this immortal trilogy is eerily enticing on its own. But just lift the lid, slide the first tape from its ghostly sleeve, and you'll soon embrace the hypnotic realm of the undead. Book 1, Interview with the Vampire , opens with the seductive purr of F. Murray Abraham ( Amadeus ) stating, "I was a 25-year-old man when I became a vampire, and the year was 1791." And so our ultimate antihero, Louis, begins the elaborate retelling of his long, tortured life as a vampire. Winding through the ages, from New Orleans to Paris, we follow Louis and his undying mentor, Lestat, as they feed on humans, whet their carnal appetites, and uncover an underworld of vampire brethren.

Michael York ( Cabaret ) puts his wonderfully fluid, cosmopolitan voice to good use, adding a dash of sly humor to this fast-paced, satisfying blend of sex and blood and rock and roll. The Vampire Lestat, read by Michael York Running time: 3 hours on 2 Audio Cassettes ----------------------------------------------- Book 3, The Queen of the Damned , takes us back, all the way back to ancient Egypt, exposing the origins of the vampire way. Narrating in eerily serene and gracious tones, Kate Nelligan ( The Prince of Tides ) leads us gently down this bloody path of immortal desires. David Purdham gives the voice of Lestat a wistful quality, tinged with an evil relish that exposes the master vampire's sanguine tastes. Queen of the Damned, read by Kate Nelligan and David Purdham Running time: 3 hours on 2 Audio Cassettes ----------------------------------------------- Anne Rice has continued her Vampire Chronicles beyond these three novels, but that shouldn't make this collection any less tempting to either the undead initiate or certified vampire junkie. --George Laney Total: 6 Audio Cassettes / 9 hours ~
