1725399:::::Talking Heads:::::Alan Bennett sealed his reputation as the master of observation with this series of 12 groundbreaking monologues, originally filmed for BBC Television. At once darkly comic, tragically poignant and wonderfully uplifting, Talking Heads is widely regarded as a modern classic. This edition, which contains the complete collection of Talking Heads , as well as his earlier monologue, A Woman of No Importance , is a celebration of Alan Bennett's finest work.
