17286817:::::Conjured:::::Eve has a new home, a new face, and a new name but no memories of her past. She s been told that she's in a witness protection program. That she escaped a dangerous magic-wielding serial killer who still hunts her. The only thing she knows for sure is that there is something horrifying in her memories the people hiding her want to access and there is nothing they won t say or do to her to get her to remember. At night she dreams of a tattered carnival tent and buttons being sewn into her skin. But during the day, she shelves books at the local library, trying to not let anyone know that she can do things things like change the color of her eyes or walk through walls. When she does use her strange powers, she blacks out and is drawn into terrifying visions, returning to find that days or weeks have passed and she s lost all short-term memories. Eve must find out who and what she really is before the killer finds her but the truth may be more dangerous than anyone could have ever imagined.
