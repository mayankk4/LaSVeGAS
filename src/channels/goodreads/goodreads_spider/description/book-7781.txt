7781:::::The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins:::::Celebrate the 75th birthday of this classic treatise on bullying by Dr. Seuss with our new foil-covered, color-enhanced Anniversary Edition! The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins is the story of a young peasant and his unjust treatment at the hands of King Derwin. While The 500 Hats is one of Dr. Seuss's earliest and lesser known works, it is nevertheless totally Seussian and as topical today as when it was first published in 1938, addressing subjects that we know the good doctor was passionate about throughout his life: the abuse of power (as in Yertle the Turtle and Horton Hears a Who ); rivalry (as in The Sneetches ); and of course, zany good humor (as in The Cat in the Hat and the 43 other books he wrote and illustrated)! Available for a limited time only, this is a perfect way to introduce new readers to an old classic or to reward existing fans. Follow more of Bartholomew's adventures in Bartholomew and the Oobleck , a Caldecott Honor Award-winner.
