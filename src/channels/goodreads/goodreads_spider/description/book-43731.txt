43731:::::Ministry of Space:::::From creative giants Warren Ellis ( Transmetroplitan ) and Chris Weston ( The Filth ) comes an alternative history painted in red, white and blue! In the death throes of the Second World War, the British capture the cream of Nazi rocket science and create a new British Empire where it seems the sun never sets. Instead the sky is lit by the rockets' red glare from a fleet of spaceships bound for the moon and beyond. But who funds this epic endeavour? The truth is the road to space is paved with a secret dark enough to bring the empire to its knees! This searing, satirical and beautifully drawn look at empire building exposes the horrors that have sometimes been carried out in the name of King &amp; Country!
