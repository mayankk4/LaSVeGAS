11544476:::::When We Wake:::::Sixteen-year-old Tegan is just like every other girl living in 2027 she's happiest when playing the guitar, she's falling in love for the first time, and she's joining her friends to protest the wrongs of the world: environmental collapse, social discrimination, and political injustice. But on what should have been the best day of Tegan's life, she dies and wakes up a hundred years later, locked in a government facility with no idea what happened.
