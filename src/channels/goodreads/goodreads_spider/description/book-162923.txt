162923:::::A Ticket to the Boneyard:::::Matt Scudder put the brilliant and elusive James Leo Motley behind bars - for good, or so he hoped. Because Motley went down swearing revenge on Scudder and anyone who knew him. Twelve years later, Motley is out and giving his psychopathic tendencies free rein.
