10728435:::::The Oracle's Message:::::"Men would do anything for it...but one woman will determine its fate"Steeped in legend, the Pearl of Palawan has a history marked by destruction, vengeance and love. But more important, the mythical black pearl is rumored to grant a power long coveted by mankind--immortality. It is a power men would risk dying to achieve. Sun, sand and scuba diving in the Philippines certainly sounded like an ideal vacation. But after a way-too-close-for-comfort encounter with a tiger shark, archaeologist Annja Creed finds herself drawn into a group of German divers. They are treasure hunters searching for the fabled pearl. Out of curiosity, Annja accompanies them. But when an old friend of hers turns up unexpectedly, she finds herself torn between her past and new acquaintances. The race is on to possess the pearl. But no one realizes the true nature of the artifact, or the danger it poses to them all.
