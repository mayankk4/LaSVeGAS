15706512:::::Shark Bait:::::Previously homeschooled Camie Ramsey is being shoved into the shark-infested waters of public high school, where even helium filled, penguin bespeckled arm floaties likely won t help keep her inexperienced, fifteen-year old head above water in that rip current of hormones and emotions. Camie s worldly wisdom might be severely lacking (i.e., the closest she s come to being kissed was sitting too close to the TV whilst Jake Ryan leaned in to give Samantha that fateful 16th birthday kiss), but she does understand her only hope for survival is if she s thrown some kind of social life preserver before she sinks like a freaking rock. However, what will her fate be when she endeavors to flag down the only lifeguard on duty, the enormously popular and ridiculously beautiful Tristan Daniels? The most sought after and virtually most unattainable guy in school who not only makes Camie s heart flatline on a recurring basis, he s also the one guy who seemingly doesn t know she exists. Feeling like an inept piece of chum that could ultimately be swallowed by Jaws, can Camie get Tristan to rescue her from floundering in the treacherous deep, or is she destined to be Shark Bait? Author's Note: While the tales themselves are fictional, some of the events and characters are very loosely based in reality and on my experiences but don t worry, the names of the characters, most of their unfortunate fashion sense and/or questionable taste in music has been changed to protect the not-so innocent. Due to language and some adult content, this book may not be suitable for readers under the age of 16.
