28676:::::American Psycho:::::Patrick Bateman is twenty-six and he works on Wall Street, he is handsome, sophisticated, charming and intelligent. He is also a psychopath. Taking us to head-on collision with America's greatest dream and its worst nightmare American Psycho is bleak, bitter, black comedy about a world we all recognise but do not wish to confront.
