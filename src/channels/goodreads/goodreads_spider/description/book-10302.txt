10302:::::The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam:::::Twice a winner of the Pulitzer Prize, author Barbara Tuchman now tackles the pervasive presence of folly in governments thru the ages. Defining folly as the pursuit by governments of policies contrary to their own interests, despite the availability of feasible alternatives, Tuchman details four decisive turning points in history that illustrate the very heights of folly in government: the Trojan War, the breakup of the Holy See provoked by Renaissance Popes, the loss of the American colonies by Britain's George III &amp; the USA's persistent folly in Vietnam. THE MARCH OF FOLLY brings the people, places &amp; events of history alive for today's reader.
