2287468:::::The Last Wish:::::Geralt de Rivia is a witcher. A cunning sorcerer. A merciless assassin. And a cold-blooded killer. His sole purpose: to destroy the monsters that plague the world. But not everything monstrous-looking is evil and not everything fair is good...and in every fairy tale there is a grain of truth. A collection of short stories introducing de Rivia, to be followed by the first novel in the actual series, The Blood of Elves . Note that, while The Last Wish was published after The Sword of Destiny , the stories contained in The Last Wish take place first chronologically, and many of the individual stories were published before The Sword of Destiny .
