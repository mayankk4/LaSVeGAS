27015399:::::A Promise of Fire:::::"I can say, without a doubt, that A Promise of Fire is going on my keeper shelf...I cannot remember the last time I wanted to both savor and devour a book." Smart Bitches, Trashy Books KINGDOMS WILL RISE AND FALL FOR HER... BUT NOT IF SHE CAN HELP IT Catalia "Cat" Fisa lives disguised as a soothsayer in a traveling circus. She is perfectly content avoiding the danger and destiny the Gods-and her homicidal mother-have saddled her with. That is, until Griffin, an ambitious warlord from the magic-deprived south, fixes her with his steely gaze and upsets her illusion of safety forever. Griffin knows Cat is the Kingmaker, the woman who divines the truth through lies. He wants her as a powerful weapon for his newly conquered realm-until he realizes he wants her for much more than her magic. Cat fights him at every turn, but Griffin's fairness, loyalty, and smoldering advances make him increasingly hard to resist and leave her wondering if life really does have to be short, and lived alone.
