2288200:::::Love Starts with Elle:::::Elle's living the dream but is it her dream or his? Elle loves life in Beaufort, South Carolina lazy summer days on the sand bar, coastal bonfires, and dinners with friends sharing a lifetime of memories. And she's found her niche as the owner of a successful art gallery too. Life is good. Then the dynamic pastor of her small town church sweeps her off her feet. She's never known a man like Jeremiah one who breathes in confidence and exhales all doubt. When he proposes in the setting sunlight, Elle hands him her heart on a silver platter. But Jeremiah's just accepted a large pastorate in a different state. If she's serious about their relationship, Elle will take "the call," too, leaving behind the people and place she loves so dearly. Elle's friendship with her new tenant, widower Heath McCord, and his young daughter make things even more complicated. Is love transferrable across the miles? And can you take it with you when you go?"
