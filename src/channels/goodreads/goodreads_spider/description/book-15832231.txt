15832231:::::All in Good Time:::::Dessa Caldwell has a dream: to open Pierson House, a refuge for former prostitutes in Denver s roughest neighborhood. But after exhausting all charitable donations, Dessa still needs a loan, and nearly every bank in town has turned her down. Her last hope hinges on the owner of Hawkins National Bank. Henry Hawkins has a secret: though he owns the most successful bank in town, his initial capital came from three successful raids on Wells Fargo coaches. Now he s the most eligible bachelor in Denver, but to protect his criminal past, he s built a fortress around his heart. Not even the boldest matchmaking mother can tempt him . . . until the day Dessa Caldwell ventures into his bank requesting a loan. Though he s certain her proposal is a bad investment, Henry is drawn to Dessa s passion. But that same passion drives her to make rash decisions about Pierson House . . . and about whom she can trust. One man might hold the key to the future of her mission but he also threatens to bring Henry s darkest secrets to light. As the walls around their hearts begin to crumble, Henry and Dessa must choose between their plans and God s, between safety and love.
