44930:::::The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters:::::It began with a simple note: a letter of rejection from Miss Temple s fianc , written on crisp Ministry paper and delivered on her maid s silver tray. But for Miss Temple, Roger Bascombe s cruel rejection will ignite a harrowing quest for answers, plunging her into a mystery as dizzying as a hall of mirrors and a remote estate where danger abounds and all inhibitions are stripped bare. Nothing could have prepared Miss Temple for where her pursuit of Roger Bascombe would take her or for the shocking things she would find behind the closed doors of forbidding Harschmort Manor: men and women in provocative disguise, acts of licentiousness and violence, heroism and awakening. But she will also find two allies: Cardinal Chang, a brutal assassin with the heart of a poet, and a royal doctor named Svenson, at once fumbling and heroic both of whom, like her, lost someone at Harschmort Manor. As the unlikely trio search for answers hurtling them from elegant brothels to gaslit alleyways to shocking moments of self-discovery-- they are confronted by puzzles within puzzles. And the closer they get to the truth, the more their lives are in danger. For the conspiracy they face an astonishing alchemy of science, perverted religion, and lust for power is so terrifying as to be beyond belief.
