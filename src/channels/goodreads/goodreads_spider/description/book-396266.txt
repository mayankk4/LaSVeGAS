Hard, violent, devastatingly attractive, Malone is the opposite of India's cool, aristocratic fianc . though Malone represents all she despises, India finds herself unwillingly drawn ever closer to him - enticed by his charm, intrigued by his hidden, mysterious past. tHE WINtER ROSE brings the beginning of the turbulent twentieth century vividly to life, drawing the reader into its wretched underworld, its privileged society, and the shadowland between the two, where the strict rules of the time blur into secret passions. Praise for tHE tEA ROSE: 'Most seductive . . . the writing is so fluid you feel the author simply loves telling her story' Frank McCourt 'I loved this vividly researched and wonderfully rumbustious yarn - brilliantly told, great fun to read' Simon Winchester
