22390262:::::Slade:::::My name is Slade Merrick and I m a fucking sex addict . . . I ve been told it s a problem. But I see it as a passion; something that I m good at. And who the fuck stops something that they re good at? They want me to seek help; get my cock in check. Don't judge my lifestyle. You re no better than me. Just admit it, you like to fuck too. Sex is what I do best; my own personal high, so I embrace it instead of being ashamed. When I'm not fucking, I'm slinging drinks at Walk Of Shame or stripping my way into your bed; another thing I'm good at. Every woman s darkest fantasy brought to life. So, am I stopping? Fuck no. Sex is beautiful, raw and erotic and I get off knowing I can have it with anyone I want . . . with the exception of her. Aspen. She walks into the club swaying those hips, instantly drawing my cock to attention. She s pure perfection. That is, until she opens that mouth, drawing me in and for the first time in forever I want something more than sex. I want her and she hates it. Things get dirty. Dirty is what I like; it s how I live. But . . . she s playing a game she can never win. ***Author's note*** Due to strong language and a very high amount of dirty, sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.
