18430452:::::When Love Never Ends:::::Sam and Sara meet at a dance and soon fall in love. Sam is a college man; Sara only a junior in high school. Sara is the girl of his dreams. He wants to be with her, and she with him. Plans for that happy future are squashed when Sara's bigoted father finds out about Sam's mixed Japanese-American heritage. He refuses to allow his daughter to date a "breed," and devises a cruel scheme to separate them for good. Years later, Sara seeks legal help, and the lawyer she contacts is Sam. Though she's in a difficult personal situation, Sara's feelings for Sam are easily rekindled, as are his feelings for her. Just when it looks like they will be able to have a future together, catastrophe occurs. After months of crippling grief and depression, Sam remembers a discussion with one of his old college professors about time travel. Though Sam once scoffed at the idea, the improbable now seems his only hope: to travel back in time and change the order of events--to change their destiny.
