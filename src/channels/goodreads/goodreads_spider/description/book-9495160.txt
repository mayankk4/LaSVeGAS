9495160:::::Berrr's Vow:::::Kidnapped from Earth and transported to planet Zorn to be sold as a sex slave, Shanna is one angry, frightened woman ready to fight anyone who tries to touch her. Raised in foster care, she s not going to take any crap off some alien men no matter how big, terrifying or muscular they are. Before she can be sold, she s freed by a huge, sexy Zorn warrior... a warrior with the most beautiful blue eyes she s ever seen. Shanna demands he take her under his protection when she realizes she s stuck on Zorn. Hyvin Berrr, the leader of Zorn, thinks humans are helpless and weak. Shanna decides to teach the big hunk he s wrong by knocking him on his backside. He might think she s playing but she s trying to teach him a lesson. She s not sure if she wants to fight her feelings for the sexy alien, though if a woman has to lose a battle, this just might be the one time to concede.
