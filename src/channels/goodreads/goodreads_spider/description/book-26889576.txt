When the crash of the U.S. stock market became public knowledge in the fall of 2008, it was already old news. The real crash, the silent crash, had taken place over the previous year, in bizarre feeder markets where the sun doesn t shine and the SEC doesn t dare, or bother, to tread.

In this fitting sequel to Liar s Poker , Michael Lewis answers that question in a narrative brimming with indignation and dark humor.
