No prison can keep me from seeking revenge. Especially when it comes to her. She, the woman who put me in jail. I swore that I'd come for her, to claim what belongs to me: Her life. I'm not a good man. On the contrary, I love to be bad. It's in my veins. Just like it's in my veins to ruin her. She's an actress, pretending to be a saint, but we both know that isn't true. One way or another, she'll pay for what she did. I will hunt for her. Make her fear me. Make her body mine. Bad deeds never go unpunished ... And I always go out with a bang.
