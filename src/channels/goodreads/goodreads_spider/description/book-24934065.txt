For humans, it s an unforgiving place, especially if you re poor, orphaned, or female. Amani Al Hiza is all three.

Then she meets Jin, a rakish foreigner, in a shooting contest, and sees him as the perfect escape route. But though she s spent years dreaming of leaving Dustwalk, she never imagined she d gallop away on mythical horse or that it would take a foreign fugitive to show her the heart of the desert she thought she knew.
