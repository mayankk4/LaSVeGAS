732562:::::The Rime of the Ancient Mariner:::::The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (originally "The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere") is the longest major poem by the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, written in 1797 98 and published in 1798 in the first edition of Lyrical Ballads . Modern editions use a later revised version printed in 1817 and featuring a gloss. Along with other poems in Lyrical Ballads , it was a signal shift to modern poetry and the beginning of British Romantic literature. It relates the events experienced by a mariner who has returned from a long sea voyage. The Mariner stops a man on his way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story. The Wedding-Guest's reaction turns from bemusement to impatience, fear, and fascination as the Mariner's story progresses, as can be seen in the language style: for example, the use of narrative techniques such as personification and repetition to create a sense of danger, or the supernatural, or serenity, depending on the mood each different part of the poem.
