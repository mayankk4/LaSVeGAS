15814895:::::Darklove:::::Utterly destroyed, or lost forever? This is the question that plagues Riley Poe. After her vampire lover, Eli Dupre, was seemingly murdered by a fallen angel, she receives word that he's actually trapped in an alternate dimension, where hell on earth is revealed and dark forces reign. Riley s been there before, and it nearly ripped her to pieces. But her efforts to find Eli are thwarted by a new foe: a powerful, unstoppable vampire is slaughtering humans. Riley knows how to handle a vamp, and with the WUP team by her side, she's determined to take down the rogue. But what she finds rocks her to the core, as she discovers a startling connection between the slaughter and Eli, who might not be missing after all and who might not be the same vampire she fell in love with.
