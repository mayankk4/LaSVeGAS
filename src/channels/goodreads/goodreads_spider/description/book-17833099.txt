17833099:::::Price of a Kiss:::::*new adult romance* **explicit scenes and language** I don t care what my cousin says; I am not the queen of impossible relationships. I mean, just because my last boyfriend tried to kill me and left a bit of a scar on my neck, then forced me to move across the country and legally change my name to Reese Randall to escape him, does not mean Oh, who am I kidding? For a freshman in college, I have to have the worst dating track record ever. It s no wonder love is the last thing on my mind when Mason Lowe enters my life. But the chemistry between us is like bam! Our connection defies logic. And he s just so freaking hot. Being around him makes me feel more alive than I ve ever felt before. I even like bickering with him. He could be my soul mate...except for one teeny tiny glitch. He's a gigolo. Boy, do I know how to pick them.
