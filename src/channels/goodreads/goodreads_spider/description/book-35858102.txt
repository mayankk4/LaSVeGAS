35858102:::::Genuine Fraud:::::6 hours and 43 minutes From the author of the unforgettable New York Times bestseller We Were Liars comes a masterful new psychological suspense novel--the story of a young woman whose diabolical smarts are her ticket into a charmed life. But how many times can someone reinvent themselves? You be the judge. Imogen is a runaway heiress, an orphan, a cook, and a cheat. Jule is a fighter, a social chameleon, and an athlete. An intense friendship. A disappearance. A murder, or maybe two. A bad romance, or maybe three. Blunt objects, disguises, blood, and chocolate. The American dream, superheroes, spies, and villains. A girl who refuses to give people what they want from her. A girl who refuses to be the person she once was. Praise for E. Lockhart's We Were Liars "Haunting, sophisticated. . . . Twisty and well-told." -- The Wall Street Journal "[It] will leave you dying to talk about the book with a pal or ten." --Parade.com "You're going to want to remember the title. Liars details the summers of a girl who harbors a dark secret, and delivers a satisfying but shocking twist ending." -- Entertainment Weekly "An ambitious novel with an engaging voice, a clever plot and some terrific writing." -- The New York Times Book Review "Thrilling, beautiful, and blisteringly smart, We Were Liars is utterly unforgettable." --John Green, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Fault in Our Stars
