29358729:::::Forever Pucked:::::Being engaged to Alex Waters, team captain and the highest paid NHL player in the league, is awesome. How could it not be? In addition to being an amazing hockey player, he s an incurable romantic with an XL heart, and an XXL hockey stick in his pants. And he knows how to use it. Incredibly, orgasmically well. Alex is the whole package and more. Literally. Like his package is insane. Total world record holder material. So it makes complete sense that Violet Hall can t wait to nail him down to the matrimonial mattress and become Mrs. Violet Waters. It's so romantic. Violet is totally stoked to set a date. Eventually. At some point. Likely before the next millennium. Or when Violet stops getting hives every time someone brings up the wedding, and their mothers stop colluding on stadium sized venues. Whichever comes first.
