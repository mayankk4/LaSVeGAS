26228034:::::The Obelisk Gate:::::THIS IS THE WAY THE WORLD ENDS... FOR THE LAST TIME. The season of endings grows darker as civilization fades into the long cold night. Alabaster Tenring madman, world-crusher, savior has returned with a mission: to train his successor, Essun, and thus seal the fate of the Stillness forever. It continues with a lost daughter, found by the enemy. It continues with the obelisks, and an ancient mystery converging on answers at last. The Stillness is the wall which stands against the flow of tradition, the spark of hope long buried under the thickening ashfall. And it will not be broken.
