Considering himself a humble citizen of the greatest nation in the world, Jun Do becomes a professional kidnapper who must navigate the shifting rules, arbitrary violence, and baffling demands of his Korean overlords in order to stay alive.

A towering literary achievement, The Orphan Master s Son ushers Adam Johnson into the small group of today s greatest writers.
