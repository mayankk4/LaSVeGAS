320601:::::Watermark:::::In this brief, intense, gem-like book, equal parts extended autobiographical essay and prose poem, Brodsky turns his eye to the seductive and enigmatic city of Venice. A mosaic of 48 short chapters each recalling a specific episode from one of his many visits there (Brodsky spent his winters in Venice for nearly 20 years) Watermark associatively and brilliantly evokes one city's architectural and atmospheric character. In doing so, the book also reveals a subject and an author readers have never before seen.
