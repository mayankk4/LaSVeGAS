18131119:::::Locke:::::Darkness is the only thing I see. Ever since the day my life changed. The day that everything and everyone I held close to me ceased to exist. The day I lost it all and the demons of my past consumed my every waking moment. I tried to keep others at arm s length. Tried not to let my darkness taint them. Ruin them. Harm them. And whether I want to admit it or not, as much as I wish I could keep them locked out, they refuse to leave. Refuse to let me suffer alone. If I hadn t been so focused on keeping those demons from flying free, I wouldn t have missed how one perfect angel was able to sneak her way under my skin refusing to let go. Making me want things I don t deserve. She consumes me. Her beauty knows no end. The love she promises tempts me every time she s near. But that pure heart that makes her MY Emmy is the one thing I m convinced I ll destroy if I ever let her close. I m a broken man. A broken man with too much darkness in his soul to ever let her light shine upon me. But even that doesn t stop me from craving her with every single breath in my body.
