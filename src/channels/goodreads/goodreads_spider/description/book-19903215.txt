19903215:::::The Art of Neil Gaiman:::::Novelist, comics writer, scriptwriter, poet and occasional artist, there are few creative avenues Neil Gaiman hasn't venture down - from unforgettable books like The ocean at the end of the lane and American gods to groundbreaking comics and graphic novels like The Sandman and Violent cases; from big screen fantasies like Coraline and Stardust to small screen epics like Doctor Who and Neverwhere; and from short stories to songwriting, stage plays to radio plays, journalism to filmmaking, and all points in-between. This tells the full story of his amazing creative life. Never-before-seen manuscripts, notes, cartoons, drawings and personal photographs from Neil's own archive are complemented by artwork and sketches from all of his major works, and his own intimate recollections. Each project is examined from genesis to fruition, and positioned in the wider narrative of Gaiman's crative life, affording unparalleled access to the inner workings of the writers mind
