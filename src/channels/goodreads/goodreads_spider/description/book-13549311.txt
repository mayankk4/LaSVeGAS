13549311:::::Lucky Stars:::::Belle Abbot is pathologically shy and because of this, she s living a nightmare due to the fact that she s also a national treasure hounded by the media. James Bennett is known the world over as the perfect catch, handsome, wealthy and the owner of an intimidating castle on a Cornish Cliff, Chy An Als Point. Belle and James meet and in one night, they fall in love. The problem is, Belle s dating James s brother. As quickly as they fall together, Belle and James are torn apart. Not long after, circumstances throw them back into each other s lives and they find they were right that first romantic night, they were meant to be. Even if their families want them together, James s brother Miles does not. Dogged by a rabid media who are fascinated by their love triangle, as well as Belle s hidden demons, James and Belle find they have yet another problem to solve. The Point is haunted by the ghosts of two children murdered in the castle. Their murderer will stop at nothing to keep their souls tethered to The Point instead of letting them live eternity with their mother and father. Belle is determined to find her courage and help them and she enlists her loopy mother, loopier grandmother, James s even loopier ex-girlfriend and the dubious (but talented) team of rock n roll witch Cassandra McNabb and Scottish ghost hunter extraordinaire Angus McPherson to help the children find their way back home.
