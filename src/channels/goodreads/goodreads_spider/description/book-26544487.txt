What on earth happened to the real Scarlet, and why is the school trying to keep it a secret? Luckily for Ivy, Scarlet isn't about to disappear without a fight. She's left pieces of her journal carefully hidden all over the school for Ivy to find. Ivy's going to figure out what happened to Scarlet. She's got to. But the staff of Rookwood is always watching, and they'll do anything to keep their secrets buried...
