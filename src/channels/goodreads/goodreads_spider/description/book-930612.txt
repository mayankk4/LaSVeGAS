930612:::::Judy Moody:::::The book that started it all--now in paperback! Judy Moody was in a mood. Not a good mood. A bad mood. A mad-faced mood. Judy Moody doesn't have high hopes for third grade. But she does have an abundance of individuality and attitude, and when Mr. Todd assigns the class a special Me Project, she really gets a chance to express herself! Megan McDonald's spirited text and Peter Reynolds's wry illustrations will delight any kid who's known a bad mood or a bad day - and managed to laugh anyway.
