22692740:::::Symptoms of Being Human:::::The first thing you re going to want to know about me is: Am I a boy, or am I a girl? Riley Cavanaugh is many things: Punk rock. Snarky. Rebellious. And gender fluid. Some days Riley identifies as a boy, and others as a girl. The thing is Riley isn t exactly out yet. And between starting a new school and having a congressman father running for reelection in uber-conservative Orange County, the pressure media and otherwise is building up in Riley s so-called normal life. On the advice of a therapist, Riley starts an anonymous blog to vent those pent-up feelings and tell the truth of what it s REALLY like to be a gender fluid teenager. But just as Riley s starting to settle in at school even developing feelings for a mysterious outcast the blog goes viral, and an unnamed commenter discovers Riley s real identity, threatening exposure. Riley must make a choice: walk away from what the blog has created a lifeline, new friends, a cause to believe in or stand up, come out, and risk everything.
