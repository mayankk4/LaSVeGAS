There s Nick, Cas, Trev . . . and Sam, who has stolen Anna s heart. When the Branch decides it s time to take the boys, Sam stages an escape, killing the agents sent to retrieve them. Anna is torn between following Sam or staying behind in the safety of her everyday life. But her father pushes her to flee, making Sam promise to keep her away from the Branch, at all costs. There s just one problem. Sam and the boys don t remember anything before living in the lab not even their true identities. Now on the run, Anna soon discovers that she and Sam are connected in more ways than either of them expected. And if they re both going to survive, they must piece together the clues of their past before the Branch catches up to them and steals it all away.
