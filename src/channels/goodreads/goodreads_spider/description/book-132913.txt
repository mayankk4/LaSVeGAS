132913:::::Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution 1863-1877:::::This "masterful treatment of one of the most complex periods of American history" ( New Republic ) made history when it was originally published in 1988. It redefined how Reconstruction was viewed by historians and people everywhere in its chronicling of how Americans -- black and white -- responded to the unprecedented changes unleashed by the war and the end of slavery. This "smart book of enormous strengths" ( Boston Globe ) has since gone on to become the classic work on the wrenching post-Civil War period -- an era whose legacy reverberates still today in the United States.
