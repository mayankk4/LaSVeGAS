34284:::::The Chronicles of Chrestomanci, Vol. 1:::::There is an alternate cover here . In this multiple parallel universes of the Twelve Related Worlds, only an enchanter with nine lives is powerful enough to control the rampant misuse of magic--and to hold the title Chrestomanci...

Who could have dreamed that both Christopher and Cat were born with nine lives--or that they could lose them so quickly?
