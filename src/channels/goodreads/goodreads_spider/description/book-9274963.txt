9274963:::::Fareler ve Insanlar:::::The compelling story of two outsiders striving to find their place in an unforgiving world. Drifters in search of work, George and his simple-minded friend Lennie have nothing in the world except each other and a dream--a dream that one day they will have some land of their own. Eventually they find work on a ranch in California s Salinas Valley, but their hopes are doomed as Lennie, struggling against extreme cruelty, misunderstanding and feelings of jealousy, becomes a victim of his own strength. Tackling universal themes such as the friendship of a shared vision, and giving voice to America s lonely and dispossessed, Of Mice and Men has proved one of Steinbeck s most popular works, achieving success as a novel, a Broadway play and three acclaimed films.
