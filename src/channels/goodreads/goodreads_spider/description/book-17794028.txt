Peyton Lockhart and her sisters have inherited Bishop s Cove, a small, luxurious oceanfront resort, but it comes with a condition: The girls must run the resort for one year and show a profit only then will they own it. A graduate of a prestigious French culinary school, Peyton has just lost her job as a food critic. Out of work and in a bad place personally, a year doing something completely different sounds wonderful. There are countless challenges and too many people who want to stop the sisters from succeeding. Among them are Peyton s contentious cousins, who are outraged that they didn t inherit the resort, as well as a powerful group of land developers who have been eyeing the coveted beachfront property. It s soon apparent to Peyton that their efforts are being sabotaged, but she refuses to let the threats scare her until she s nearly killed. She calls on her childhood friend and protector, Finn MacBain, now with the FBI, and asks for his help. He saved her life once; he can do it again.
