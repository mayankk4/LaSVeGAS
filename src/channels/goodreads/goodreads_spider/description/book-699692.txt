699692:::::The Sackett Brand:::::Forty gunslingers from the Lazy A have got Tell Sackett cornered under the Mogollon Rim. They're fixing to hang him if they can capture him alive, fill him extra full of lead if they can't. But the Sacketts don't cotton to that kind of treatment. Hunt one Sackett and you hunt 'em all. So they're riding in from all over mountain Sacketts, outlaws, cattlemen, bankers and the rest. They'll fight with Tell on this one if they can get there before Tell kills all forty hardcases himself.
