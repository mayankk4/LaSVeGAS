617510:::::Unzipped:::::ANALYZE THIS. Chrissy McMullen has made a career leap, all the way from slinging drinks at Chicago s most notorious nightclub to dispensing psychotherapy from her sleek new practice in L.A. Even if she can t quite shed her too-loud, too-curvy alter ego or the brawling family that insists on claiming kinship. So when her most famous client, buff football star Bomber Bomstad, starts chasing her around her desk and getting, well unzipped Christina gets just a little miffed until Bomber has the bad manners to drop dead at her feet. Enter Jack Rivera, a no-nonsense detective with a grim attitude and a great butt, who s determined to prove this cocktail-waitress-turned-shrink was engaging in some very unethical behavior. Persuading Rivera that she s not a murderer isn t going to be easy. Plunging headfirst into a city full of people in need of some serious therapy, Chrissy will have to use all her street smarts, a good deal of sex appeal, and a little love to clear her name and cancel an appointment with a killer.
