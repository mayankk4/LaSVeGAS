25816447:::::Ricochet:::::The only sure way to destroy a man is to take what he cannot live without. Three years ago, I had everything. A beautiful wife. A son. A reason for living. Until a ruthless task force, assembled under Mayor Michael Culling, with a brutal strategy to make the streets of Detroit safe , ripped away everything I loved in a deadly hunt called The Culling. They tried to kill me, too. I wish they had. Now I'm cursed by the memories of that night, and the words I whispered to my dying wife. A promise to avenge the wrong and set it right. I m no longer Nick Ryder. I m a masked vigilante. Faceless. Loveless. Fearless. A man with nothing left to lose one who's seen the dark and violent truth behind the city s flawless veneer. Michael Culling doesn t know who I am. Or what I want. All he knows is that I ve kidnapped his beautiful wife. An eye for an eye isn t that how the saying goes? And Aubree Culling is the perfect pawn to destroy him. If she doesn t destroy me first.
