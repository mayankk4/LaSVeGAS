After convincing Emma that Will is dead, Raphael insists that he's the only hope for saving her son, but she resents Raphael's dangerous supernatural hold over her.

The Vinco Potentia thinks Will knows something about a woman he doesn't remember.

So while James wants to find way to sever Will's connection to Emma, but Will's not convinced he wants to be free. You are not bound to destiny. The book stolen from the Vinco Potentia holds the key to a new set of rules and everyone involved will stop at nothing to get it.
