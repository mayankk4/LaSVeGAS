35487055:::::Becoming A Vincent:::::When you live in a place where turbo speed internet is a slight step above dial-up, men carry on nine-year beard-growing challenges out of stubborn pride, and your brothers do things like nail all your panties to the outside of your cabin just for funsies, you tend to be a little crazy. You can call it a "locational" hazard, if you will. That s Tomahawk for you. We rank people based on just how crazy they are. And the four craziest families in town are called the Wild Ones. I m on the bottom tier of those, so technically I m not as crazy as the other Wild Ones. In fact, if it wasn t for my brothers and their endless antics, I wouldn t be considered a Wild One at all. Ahem. Sure. We ll go with that. Anyway, I have a best friend who endures it all with me. Benson Nolans is my one, constant favorite person. Without him, I d probably go really crazy, and not the fun kind. It d be ridiculous, after three years of a flawless friendship, to mess that all up by falling for him. I mean, even if we did get a little too close one night, it d be reckless endangerment. Even if we did suddenly feel the chemistry that s always been there and stop toeing the line, it d be a foolish risk to take. It d be stupid to start hoping a really fun, but completely irrational, night with zero inhibitions might accidentally happen. Really stupid Right? *NO cliffhanger *Stand-alone book *Sexual Content *Adult language *Completely, 100% crazy
