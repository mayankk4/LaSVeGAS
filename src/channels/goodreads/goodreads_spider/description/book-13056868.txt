13056868:::::Vessel:::::Liyana has trained her entire life to be the vessel of a goddess. She will dance and summon her tribe's deity, who will inhabit Liyana's body and use magic to bring rain to the desert. But when the dance ends, Liyana is still there. Her tribe is furious and sure that it is Liyana's fault. Abandoned by her tribe, Liyana expects to die in the desert. Until a boy walks out of the dust in search of her. Korbyn is a god inside his vessel, and a trickster god at that. He tells Liyana that five other gods are missing, and they set off across the desert in search of the other vessels. The desert tribes cannot survive without the magic of their gods. But the journey is dangerous, even with a god s help. And not everyone is willing to believe the trickster god s tale. The closer she grows to Korbyn, the less Liyana wants to disappear to make way for her goddess. But she has no choice she must die for her tribe to live. Unless a trickster god can help her to trick fate or a human girl can muster some magic of her own.
