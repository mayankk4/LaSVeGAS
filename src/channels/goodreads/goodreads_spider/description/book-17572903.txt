17572903:::::The Girl You Left Behind:::::Jojo Moyes s bestseller, Me Before You, catapulted her to wide critical acclaim and has struck a chord with readers everywhere. Hopelessly and hopefully romantic (Chicago Tribune), Moyes returns with another irresistible heartbreaker that asks, Whatever happened to the girl you left behind? France, 1916: Artist Edouard Lefevre leaves his young wife, Sophie, to fight at the front. When their small town falls to the Germans in the midst of World War I, Edouard s portrait of Sophie draws the eye of the new Kommandant. As the officer s dangerous obsession deepens, Sophie will risk everything her family, her reputation, and her life to see her husband again. Almost a century later, Sophie s portrait is given to Liv Halston by her young husband shortly before his sudden death. A chance encounter reveals the painting s true worth, and a battle begins for who its legitimate owner is putting Liv s belief in what is right to the ultimate test. Like Sarah Blake s The Postmistress and Tatiana de Rosnay s Sarah s Key, The Girl You Left Behind is a breathtaking story of love, loss, and sacrifice told with Moyes s signature ability to capture our hearts with every turn of the page.
