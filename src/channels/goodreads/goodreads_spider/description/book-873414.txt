873414:::::Imadoki! Nowadays, Vol. 1:::::For Tanpopo Yamazaki, life at the elitist Mei Academy seems way out of her league. The daughters of wealthy families snub her; other students make light of the fact that she actually tested into Mei instead of relying on family connections, and the cute boy she saw tending a dandelion the day before wouldn't even acknowledge her existence. Hoping to make friends and have some fun, Tanpopo starts up a gardening committee, but will this help her survive in a school where superficiality and nepotism reign supreme? IMA DOKI follows the trials and tribulations of a budding horticulturist as she makes her way down the winding road to friendship. From Y Watase, one of Japan's most beloved sh jo artists, IMA DOKI packs comedic charm and heartfelt antics into an adorable bouquet of whimsical fantasy.
