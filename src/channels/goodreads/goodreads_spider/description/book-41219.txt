41219:::::Possession:::::Possession is an exhilarating novel of wit and romance, at once an intellectual mystery and triumphant love story. It is the tale of a pair of young scholars researching the lives of two Victorian poets. As they uncover their letters, journals, and poems, and track their movements from London to Yorkshire from spiritualist s ances to the fairy-haunted far west of Brittany what emerges is an extraordinary counterpoint of passions and ideas. Man Booker Prize Winner (1990)
