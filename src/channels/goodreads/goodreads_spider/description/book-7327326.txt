7327326:::::Half Upon a Time:::::Life s no fairy tale for Jack. After all, his father's been missing ever since that incident with the beanstalk and the giant, and his grandfather keeps pushing him to get out and find a princess to rescue. Who'd want to rescue a snobby, entitled princess anyway? Especially one that falls out of the sky wearing a shirt that says "Punk Princess," and still denies she's royalty. In fact, May doesn't even believe in magic. Yeah, what's that about? May does need help though--a huntsman is chasing her, her grandmother has been kidnapped, and Jack thinks it s all because of the Wicked Queen . . . mostly because May s grandmother might just be the long-lost Snow White. Jack and May's thrillingly hilarious adventure combines all the classic stories fractured as a broken magic mirror into the first of an epic new series of novels for the ages.
