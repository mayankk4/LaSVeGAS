22611804:::::Prisoner:::::He seethes with raw power the first time I see him pure menace and rippling muscles in shackles. He s dangerous. He s wild. He s the most beautiful thing I ve ever seen. So I hide behind my prim glasses and my book like I always do, because I have secrets too. Then he shows up in the prison writing class I have to teach, and he blows me away with his honesty. He tells me secrets in his stories, and it s getting harder to hide mine. I shiver when he gets too close, with only the cuffs and the bars and the guards holding him back. At night I can t stop thinking about him in his cell. But that s the thing about an animal in a cage you never know when he ll bite. He might use you to escape. He might even pull you into a forest and hold a hand over your mouth so you can t call for the cops. He might make you come so hard, you can t think. And you might crave him more than your next breath.
