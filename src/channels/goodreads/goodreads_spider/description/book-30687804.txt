30687804:::::Long Way Home:::::Seventeen-year-old Violet has always been expected to sit back and let the boys do all the saving. It s the code her father, a member of the Reign of Terror motorcycle club, raised her to live by. Yet when her dad is killed carrying out Terror business, Violet knows it s up to her to do the saving. To protect herself, and her vulnerable younger brother, she needs to cut all ties with the club including Chevy, the boy she s known and loved her whole life. But when a rival club comes after Violet, exposing old secrets and making new threats, she s forced to question what she thought she knew about her father, the Reign of Terror, and what she thinks she wants. Which means re-evaluating everything: love, family, friends . . . and forgiveness. Caught in the crosshairs between loyalty and freedom, Violet must decide whether old friends can be trusted and if she s strong enough to be the one person to save them all.
