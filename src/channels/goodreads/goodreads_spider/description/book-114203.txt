But her own past is about to be called into question. Recruited for her expertise on the Antietam Creek dig, she encounters danger as a cloud of death and misfortune hangs over the project, and rumors fly that the site is cursed.

And when a strange woman approaches her, claiming to know a secret about Callie s privileged Boston childhood, some startling and unsettling questions are raised about her very identity. Searching for answers, trying to rebuild, Callie finds that there are deceptions and sorrows that refuse to stay buried. And as she struggles to put the pieces back together, she discovers that the healing process comes with consequences and that there are people who will do anything to make sure the truth is never revealed
