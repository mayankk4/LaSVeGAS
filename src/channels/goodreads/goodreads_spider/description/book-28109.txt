28109:::::Shrimp:::::Sassy Cyd Charisse returns in Shrimp, the compelling and light-hearted ( Publishers Weekly , starred review) sequel to the sharp and funny novel Gingerbread . If Cyd Charisse knows one thing, it s that Shrimp is her true love. Shrimp, the hottest pint-size surfer-artist in San Francisco. That boy (as her mother called him), who was the primary cause of Cyd being grounded to Alcatraz, formerly known as her room. The boy who dumped Cyd before she left home to spend the summer in New York City. Now it s the start of senior year. Cyd has changed, but maybe Shrimp has changed too and maybe Cyd and Shrimp will need to get to know each other all over again to figure out if it s for real. Can Cyd get back together with Shrimp and keep the peace with her mom? And can she get a life outside of her all-encompassing boy radar? This sequel to Gingerbread has all the sharp humor and searing attitude of the original, which ELLEgirl praised as not just Another Teen Novel and Teen People called unforgettable. In Shrimp, Cyd might be a little older and a little wiser, but she s still the same irrepressible free spirit determined to find her own way in the world, on her own terms.
