12204117:::::The Seed:::::Throughout our lives, many things may lead us to forget who we truly are. Result? Slowly yet inevitably, cages and chains enslave our thoughts and slay our freedoms. Down the ages, men have thus fallen for hosts of illusions, confusions and fears - except for the seven dreamers whose stories this book contains. These mad truth-seekers (who oddly share the same name) did not follow others' flow to slavery; rather, they heeded a voice in their heads that led them to obsession with an idea long thought extinct, buried beneath the sands of time: The Seed. In this book you will take a rollicking metaphysical ride that starts in ancient Egypt, moves to the Grand Greek Era, then to Rome, Arab Alexandria, on piratic High Seas, to Switzerland and circuses, into a Christian era interlude, then to modern Egypt (2007) and lastly, to a sort of Garden of Visionary Epiphany that will leaves you on and past the brink of enlightenment... This Past was the future of the present - how in the world can anyone describe time insuch eloquency. Coki Coussa, Editor chief of Ladybird Magazine This book is, frankly, quite extraordinary. It contains images and whole passages of striking beauty, power and thought-provoking wisdom. Nicolas Marco, Author &amp; Senior editor.
