21485:::::The Winds of War & War & Remembrance:::::These two classic works capture the tide of world events even as they unfold the compelling tale of a single American family drawn into the very center of the war's maelstrom. The multimillion-copy bestsellers that capture all the drama, romance, heroism, and tragedy of the Second World War and that constitute Wouk's crowning achievement are available for the first time in trade paperback.
