24517372:::::Holy Cow:::::A rollicking, globe-trotting adventure with a twist: a four-legged heroine you won t soon forget Elsie Bovary is a cow, and a pretty happy one at that her long, lazy days are spent eating, napping, and chatting with her best friend, Mallory. One night, Elsie and Mallory sneak out of their pasture; but while Mallory is interested in flirting with the neighboring bulls, Elsie finds herself drawn to the farmhouse. Through the window, she sees the farmer s family gathered around a bright Box God and what the Box God reveals about something called an industrial meat farm shakes Elsie s understanding of her world to its core. There s only one solution: escape to a better, safer world. And so a motley crew is formed: Elsie; Jerry excuse me, Shalom a cranky, Torah-reading pig who s recently converted to Judaism; and Tom, a suave (in his own mind, at least) turkey who can t fly, but who can work an iPhone with his beak. Toting stolen passports and slapdash human disguises, they head for the airport. Elsie is our wise-cracking, pop-culture-reference-dropping, slyly witty narrator; Tom who does eventually learn to fly (sort of) dispenses psychiatric advice in a fake German accent; and Shalom, rejected by his adopted people in Jerusalem, ends up unexpectedly uniting Israelis and Palestinians. David Duchovny s charismatic creatures point the way toward a mutual understanding and acceptance that the world desperately needs.
