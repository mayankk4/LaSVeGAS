12700306:::::Tricked:::::Druid Atticus O Sullivan hasn t stayed alive for more than two millennia without a fair bit of Celtic cunning. So when vengeful thunder gods come Norse by Southwest looking for payback, Atticus, with a little help from the Navajo trickster god Coyote, lets them think that they ve chopped up his body in the Arizona desert. But the mischievous Coyote is not above a little sleight of paw, and Atticus soon finds that he s been duped into battling bloodthirsty desert shapeshifters called skinwalkers. Just when the Druid thinks he s got a handle on all the duplicity, betrayal comes from an unlikely source. If Atticus survives this time, he vows he won t be fooled again. Famous last words.
