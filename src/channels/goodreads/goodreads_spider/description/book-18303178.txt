18303178:::::Fire Light:::::Jake is a jeek part jock, part geek who finds out he s an unwitting target of genocide against a secret society known as the Druids a society he didn t even know he belonged to. O Brien, one of the last druids, is his mentor. Unfortunately, he is a dud when it comes to magic, but at least he is ex-military. As for picking his girlfriend . . . well, that s a split decision. Alexis and Kendra are opposites in almost every way. Now, if he can just survive the nightwalker an obsidian-skinned creature with a thirst for blood and a banshee s mind-destroying scream, who wears a cloak black enough to make the grim reaper jealous then he might have a chance. Ultimately, protecting his loved ones, and himself if possible, becomes his priority.
