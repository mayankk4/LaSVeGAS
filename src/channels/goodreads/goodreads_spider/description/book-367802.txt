367802:::::Collected Poems:::::The Collected Poems of Dylan Thomas contains poems that Thomas personally decided best represented his work. A year before its publication Thomas died from swelling of the brain triggered by excessive drinking. Since its initial publication in 1953, this book has become the definitive edition of the poet s work. Thomas wrote Prologue addressed to my readers, the strangers an introduction in verse that was the last poem he would ever write. Also included are classics such as And Death Shall Have No Dominion , Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night , and Fern Hill that have influenced generations of artists from Bob Dylan (who changed his last name from Zimmerman in honor of the poet), to John Lennon (The Beatles included Thomas portrait on the cover of Sgt. Pepper s Lonely Hearts Club Band ); this collection even appears in the film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy s The Road when it is retrieved from the rubble of a bookshelf.
