13624139:::::Justin Bieber: Just Getting Started:::::"My story is something I like to share with others, to show people that with enough belief in yourself and what you can accomplish, anything is possible." Justin Bieber From Tel Aviv to Tokyo, over the past few years I've traveled around the world and back again. It's been amazing, but it's also hard to believe that not so long ago I was singing on the streets of Stratford, Ontario. I can honestly say that anything is possible, anyone can live the dream, and every day is a blessing. Now everywhere I go, I'm met with so much love. It's all about you, my fans, and that's why I'm dedicating my book to everyone who's come to sing along. I want to share the stories of my life on the road with you. From the crazy highs of performing on stage to spending those precious quiet moments with my friends and family, I want to give you a personal backstage pass to my world. It's been exhausting but always eye-opening and amazing. It's astonishing to think that so much has happened, and yet this is just the beginning. I'm just getting started.
