38192926:::::Blood and Roses:::::Maria I was trapped. There was nothing left of me. Then he came and wanted to make me his. He saved me. He gave me a home, a family. He made sweet love to me. I was his Angel. He was my everything. I thought we would live happily ever after, but there are no happy endings in the mafia life. I found this out the hard way, as the blood flowed, red as roses Lyov Angel. The word meant nothing until I saw her. I found her in a place worse than hell. She calls me her savior. But I didn t save her. I captured the pretty angel and made her mine. Life was perfect. I had everything I wanted. I was her salvation. She was my redemption. Until I lost her. Angels deserve happy endings, but monsters like me don t. My darkness became hers, and our happily-ever-after became tainted.
