23664731:::::Everything, Everything:::::My disease is as rare as it is famous. Basically, I m allergic to the world. I don t leave my house, have not left my house in seventeen years. The only people I ever see are my mom and my nurse, Carla. But then one day, a moving truck arrives next door. I look out my window, and I see him. He s tall, lean and wearing all black black T-shirt, black jeans, black sneakers, and a black knit cap that covers his hair completely. He catches me looking and stares at me. I stare right back. His name is Olly. Maybe we can t predict the future, but we can predict some things. For example, I am certainly going to fall in love with Olly. It s almost certainly going to be a disaster.
