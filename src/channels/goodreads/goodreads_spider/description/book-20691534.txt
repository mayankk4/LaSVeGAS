20691534:::::Wishing for a Highlander:::::Single-and-pregnant museum worker Melanie voices an idle wish while examining a Scottish artifact, that a Highland warrior would sweep her off her feet and help her forget her cheating ex. The last thing she expects is for her wish to be granted. Magically transported to the middle of a clan skirmish in the sixteenth-century Highlands, she comes face to face with her kilted fantasy man. Tall, handsome, and heir to his uncle s lairdship, Darcy Keith should be the most eligible bachelor in Ackergill. Instead, thanks to a prank played on him in his teenage years, he is known for being too large under his kilt to ever make a proper husband. Big Darcy runs his deceased father s windmills and lives alone at his family manor, believing he will never marry. But a strangely-dressed woman he rescues from a clan skirmish makes him long for more. When the woman s claims of coming to Ackergill by magic reach the laird s ears, she is accused of witchcraft. Darcy determines to protect her any way he can, even if it means binding her to him forever.
