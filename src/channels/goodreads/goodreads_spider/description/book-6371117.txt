6371117:::::Betrayals:::::She s no angel... Poor Dru Anderson. Her parents are long gone, her best friend is a werewolf, and she s just learned that the blood flowing through her veins isn t entirely human. (So what else is new?) Now Dru is stuck at a secret New England Schola for other teens like her, and there s a big problem she s the only girl in the place. A school full of cute boys wouldn t be so bad, but Dru s killer instinct says that one of them wants her dead. And with all eyes on her, discovering a traitor within the Order could mean a lot more than social suicide... Can Dru survive long enough to find out who has betrayed her trust and maybe even her heart?
