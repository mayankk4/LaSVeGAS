16691600:::::Forever, Christian:::::Open a book, slip into the comfy seat of a movie theatre, turn on your favourite show or play your favourite video game and you will be transported to another world where you can escape from the day to day stresses of being human. However, once that story or game has ended, you will slip back into the day to day grind of the real world. Imagine being stuck in the world of make believe 24 hours a day, 7 days a week because the outside world is too confusing and painful. This is how the real world feels like for Christian Traverse. Inside you will be introduced to the world of one extraordinary boy, who at first glance, you will not find anything unusual about his sandy blond hair, his big, deep blue eyes, or even the long, dark lashes that would be the envy of any woman. You will not be taken aback by his crooked grin or the bubbly personality that can make just about anyone instantly fall in love with him. In fact, unless you know what to look for, you are not likely to notice anything different about him at all, but he is different. This world we live in is confusing, overwhelming and painful because he has a condition known as autism.
