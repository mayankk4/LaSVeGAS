That is, until an old friend presents him with an irresistible mystery, one that Mike is uniquely qualified to solve: far out in the California desert, a team of DARPA scientists has invented a device they affectionately call the Albuquerque Door.

Yet evidence is mounting that this miraculous machine isn t quite what it seems and that its creators are harboring a dangerous secret. As his investigations draw him deeper into the puzzle, Mike begins to fear there s only one answer that makes sense. And if he s right, it may only be a matter of time before the project destroys everything. A cunningly inventive mystery featuring a hero worthy of Sherlock Holmes and a terrifying final twist you ll never see coming, The Fold is that rarest of things: a genuinely page-turning science-fiction thriller. Step inside its pages and learn why author Peter Clines has already won legions of loyal fans.
