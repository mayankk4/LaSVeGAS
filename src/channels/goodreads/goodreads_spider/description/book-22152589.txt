22152589:::::Incandescent:::::Phoenix Nix Knight thought pulling his club out of the illegal shit his Pops got them into was difficult. Until he meets Kadence. Kadence Turner has no business lusting over a student s father, especially the president of the Knights Rebels MC. Nix is crass, obnoxious and dangerously sexy and for some reason, Kadence can t seem to hate him for it. The bossy biker breaks down her defenses, but unlike the old Kadence, the woman she is today won t give in without a fight. The tension is undeniable, the attraction fierce. A man that wants what he wants and a woman that will fight him every step of the way.
