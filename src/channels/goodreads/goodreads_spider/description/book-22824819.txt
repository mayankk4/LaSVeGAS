22824819:::::Inspire:::::Kalliope lives with one purpose. To inspire. As an immortal muse, she doesn t have any other choice. It s part of how she was made. Musicians, artists, actors they use her to advance their art, and she uses them to survive. She moves from one artist to the next, never staying long enough to get attached. But all she wants is a different life a normal one. She s spent thousands of years living lie after lie, and now she s ready for something real. Sweet, sexy, and steady, Wilder Bell feels more real than anything else in her long existence. And most importantly he s not an artist. He doesn t want her for her ability. But she can t turn off the way she influences people, not even to save a man she might love. Because in small doses, she can help make something beautiful, but her ability has just as much capacity to destroy as it does to create. The longer she stays, the more obsessed Wilder will become. It s happened before, and it never turns out well for the mortal. Her presence may inspire genius. But it breeds madness, too.
