12111823:::::The Winds of Winter:::::The Winds of Winter is the forthcoming sixth novel in the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin. The previous installment, A Dance with Dragons , covered less story than Martin intended, omitting at least one planned large battle sequence and leaving several character threads ending in cliffhangers. Martin intends to resolve these cliffhangers "very early" in The Winds of Winter , saying "I'm going to open with the two big battles that I was building up to, the battle in the ice and the battle at Meereen the battle of Slaver's Bay. And then take it from there."
