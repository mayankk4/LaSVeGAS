20645398:::::Trouble & the Wallflower:::::Raised in near seclusion by an agoraphobic mother, Davy Cooper s social skills are almost nonexistent. Now that his mother has died, he needs to make friends for the first time in his life. He catches Gavin Walker s eye, but the sexy, confident, bad boy hipster intimidates shy Davy so much that he throws away Gavin s number every time he offers it.

However, with his limited experience, he thinks he and Gavin are too different, and anything more than a casual acquaintance will end in complete disaster.
