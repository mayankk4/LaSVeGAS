12568:::::Trout Fishing in America / The Pill vs. the Springhill Mine Disaster / In Watermelon Sugar:::::An omnibus edition of three counterculture classics by Richard Brautigan that embody the spirit of the 1960s. Trout Fishing in America is by turns a hilarious, playful, and melancholy novel that wanders from San Francisco through America's rural waterways; In Watermelon Sugar expresses the mood of a new generation, revealing death as a place where people travel the length of their dreams, rejecting violence and hate; and The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster is a collection of nearly 100 poems, first published in 1968.
