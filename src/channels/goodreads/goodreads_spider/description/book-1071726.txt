1071726:::::The Peregrine:::::From autumn to spring, J.A. Baker set out to track the daily comings and goings of a pair of peregrine falcons across the flat fen lands of eastern England. He followed the birds obsessively, observing them in the air and on the ground, in pursuit of their prey, making a kill, eating, and at rest, activities he describes with an extraordinary fusion of precision and poetry.

It is this extraordinary metamorphosis, magical and terrifying, that these beautifully written pages record.
