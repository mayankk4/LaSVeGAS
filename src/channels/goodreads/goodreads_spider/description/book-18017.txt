18017:::::Life at Blandings:::::P.G. Wodehouse entices us into the demesne of Blandings Castle - an apparent paradise where it is eternal high summer, with jolly parties, tea on the lawn and love trysts in the rose garden. But for Clarence, ninth Earl of Emsworth, there is always something to disturb this tranquil scene. This omnibus contains Something Fresh , Summer Lightning and three short stories ( The Custody of the Pumpkin , Lord Emsworth Acts for the Best and Pig-hoo-o-o-o-ey ).
