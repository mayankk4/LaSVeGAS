12558285:::::Splintered:::::Alyssa Gardner hears the whispers of bugs and flowers precisely the affliction that landed her mother in a mental hospital years before. This family curse stretches back to her ancestor Alice Liddell, the real-life inspiration for Lewis Carroll s Alice s Adventures in Wonderland . Alyssa might be crazy, but she manages to keep it together. For now. When her mother s mental health takes a turn for the worse, Alyssa learns that what she thought was fiction is based in terrifying reality. The real Wonderland is a place far darker and more twisted than Lewis Carroll ever let on. There, Alyssa must pass a series of tests, including draining an ocean of Alice s tears, waking the slumbering tea party, and subduing a vicious bandersnatch, to fix Alice s mistakes and save her family. She must also decide whom to trust: Jeb, her gorgeous best friend and secret crush, or the sexy but suspicious Morpheus, her guide through Wonderland, who may have dark motives of his own.
