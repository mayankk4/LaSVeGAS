226706:::::If There Be Thorns:::::Out of the ashes of evil Chris and Cathy made such a loving home for their splendid children... Fourteen-year-old Jory was so handsome, so gentle. And Bart had such a dazzling imagination for a nine year old. Then the lights came on in the abandoned house next door.
