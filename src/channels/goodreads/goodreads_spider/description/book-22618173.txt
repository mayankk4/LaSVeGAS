22618173:::::What We Buried:::::This book is a cemetery of truths buried alive. The light draws you in where you will find Caitlyn there digging. When you get close enough, she'll lean in &amp; whisper, Baby, buried things will surface no matter what, get to them before they get to you first. Her unbounded love will propel you to pick up a shovel &amp; help- even though the only thing you want to do is kiss her lips, kiss her hands, kiss every one of her stretch marks &amp; the fire that is raging in pit of her stomach. She'll see your eyes made of devour &amp; sadness, she'll hug you &amp; say, Baby, if you eat me alive, I will cut my way out of your stomach. Don't let this be your funeral. Teach yourself to navigate the wound.
