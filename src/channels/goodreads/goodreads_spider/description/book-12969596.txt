12969596:::::Ordinary Magic:::::In Abby s world, magic isn t anything special: it s a part of everyday life. So when Abby learns that she has zero magical abilities, she s branded an Ord ordinary, bad luck, and quite possibly a danger to society. The outlook for kids like Abby isn t bright. Many are cast out by their families, while others are sold to treasure hunters (ordinary kids are impervious to spells and enchantments). Luckily for Abby, her family enrolls her in a school that teaches ordinary kids how to get around in a magical world. But with treasure-hunting kidnappers and carnivorous goblins lurking around every corner, Abby s biggest problem may not be learning how to be ordinary it s whether or not she s going to survive the school year!
