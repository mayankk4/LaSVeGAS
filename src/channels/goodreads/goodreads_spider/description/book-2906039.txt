2906039:::::Just After Sunset:::::Internationally bestselling author Stephen King delivers an astonishing collection of short stories. Who but Stephen King would turn a Port-O-San into a slimy birth canal, or a roadside honky-tonk into a place for endless love? A book salesman with a grievance might pick up a mute hitchhiker, not knowing the silent man in the passenger seat listens altogether too well. Or an exercise routine on a stationary bicycle, begun to reduce bad cholesterol, might take its rider on a captivating and then terrifying journey. Set on a remote key in Florida, The Gingerbread Girl is a riveting tale featuring a young woman as vulnerable and resourceful as Audrey Hepburn s character in Wait Until Dark. In Ayana, a blind girl works a miracle with a kiss and the touch of her hand. For King, the line between the living and the dead is often blurry, and the seams that hold our reality intact might tear apart at any moment. In one of the longer stories here, N., which recently broke new ground when it was adapted as a graphic digital entertainment, a psychiatric patient s irrational thinking might create an apocalyptic threat in the Maine countryside...or keep the world from falling victim to it. Just After Sunset call it dusk, call it twilight, it s a time when human intercourse takes on an unnatural cast, when the imagination begins to reach for shadows as they dissipate to darkness and living daylight can be scared right out of you. It s the perfect time for Stephen King. The stories in this collection have appeared in The New Yorker, Playboy, McSweeney s, The Paris Review, Esquire, and other publications.
