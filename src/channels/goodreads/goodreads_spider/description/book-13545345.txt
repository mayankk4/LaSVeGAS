13545345:::::Dork Diaries Book 4: Tales from a Not-So-Graceful Ice Princess:::::It s Diary of a Wimpy Kid for girls in this hilarious novel! I wasn t at all surprised to find out that my crush Brandon volunteers at a local animal shelter. He s SUCH a sweet guy OF COURSE he wants to help those adorable puppies! Then Brandon tells me that the shelter is in danger of closing, and I know I can t let that happen . . . especially when I discover a SHOCKING secret about Brandon that makes keeping that shelter open more important than ever. So I enter an ice skating competition with my friends Chloe and Zoey to help raise money for the shelter, but (big surprise!) MacKenzie has to stick her nose in and cause trouble so that SHE can be the one to swoop in and save the day. No way will I let that happen: I ll just have to come up with some extra creative ideas this time!
