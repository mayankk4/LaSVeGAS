48203:::::The Professor's House:::::On the eve of his move to a new, more desirable residence, Professor Godfrey St. Peter finds himself in the shabby study of his former home. Surrounded by the comforting, familiar sights of his past, he surveys his life and the people he has loved his wife Lillian, his daughters, and Tom Outland, his most outstanding student and once, his son-in-law to be.

But he has also left behind him a troubling legacy which has brought betrayal and fracture to the women he loves most.
