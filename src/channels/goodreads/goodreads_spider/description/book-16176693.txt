16176693:::::Enslaved:::::A dark, edgy BDSM romance Caught red-handed with her fingers in the company cash, Rae Johansen must choose between near-certain jail time or a much shorter sentence locked away in a BDSM Dungeon. Acceptance means placing her free will, her body and possibly her soul in the hands of a dominant man who demands complete submission. Whips, chains, ropes, floggers and the sensual wrath of a spurned lover are just some of what await the hapless slave girl, should she accept the terms he offers. Choose right, Rae, and choose wisely. This may be the last choice you ever make.
