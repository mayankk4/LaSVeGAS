13628172:::::Nobody:::::There are people in this world who are Nobody. No one sees them. No one notices them. They live their lives under the radar, forgotten as soon as you turn away. That s why they make the perfect assassins. The Institute finds these people when they re young and takes them away for training. But an untrained Nobody is a threat to their organization. And threats must be eliminated. Sixteen-year-old Claire has been invisible her whole life, missed by the Institute s monitoring. But now they ve ID ed her and send seventeen-year-old Nix to remove her. Yet the moment he lays eyes on her, he can t make the hit. It s as if Claire and Nix are the only people in the world for each other. And they are because no one else ever notices them.
