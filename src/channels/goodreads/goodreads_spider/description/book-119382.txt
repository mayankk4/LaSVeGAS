Lucia - the fiery Sicilian beauty on the run for murder - and Rubio Arzano, the freedom fighter who risks his life to save her. Teresa - whose guilty conscience finally drives her to betray her friends. Graciela - who bears a terrible secret that almost destroys her - and the courageous Ricardo who loves her.
