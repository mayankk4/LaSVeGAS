21408690:::::Broken:::::Lauren Layne s New Adult novel tells the story of a girl with secrets, a guy with scars, and a love that could save them both... or destroy them. When Olivia Middleton abandons the glamour of Park Avenue for a remote, coastal town in Maine, everyone assumes she s being the kind do-gooder she s always been. But Olivia has a secret: helping an injured war veteran reenter society isn t about charity it s about penance. Only, Olivia s client isn t the grateful elderly man she s expecting. Instead, he s a brooding twenty-four-year-old who has no intention of being Olivia s path to redemption . . . and whose smoldering gaze and forbidden touch might be her undoing. Paul Langdon doesn t need a mirror to show him he s no longer the hotshot quarterback he was before the war. He knows he s ugly inside and out. He ll do anything to stay in self-imposed exile, even accept his father s ultimatum that Paul tolerate the newest caretaker for three months or lose his inheritance. But Paul doesn t count on the beautiful twenty-two-year-old who makes him long for things that he can never have. And the more she slips past his defenses, the more keeping his distance is impossible. Now Paul and Olivia have to decide: Will they help each other heal? Or are they forever broken?
