7904453:::::The Broken Kingdoms:::::In the city of Shadow, beneath the World Tree, alleyways shimmer with magic and godlings live hidden among mortalkind. Oree Shoth, a blind artist, takes in a homeless man who glows like a living sun to her strange sight. This act of kindness engulfs Oree in a nightmarish conspiracy. Someone, somehow, is murdering godlings, leaving their desecrated bodies all over the city.

And is the earthly power of the Arameri king their ultimate goal, or have they set their sights on the Lord of Night himself?
