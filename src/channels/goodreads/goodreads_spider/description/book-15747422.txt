15747422:::::Natural Born Angel:::::Life exploded for Maddy Montgomery when she found out she was half-Angel and was catapulted into a world of paparazzi and fervent adulation that comes with being a celebrity Angel. Now she must juggle her ordinary existence - graduation, family, friends - with the intense demands of being in the public eye as heartthrob Angel Jackson Godspeed's girlfriend. Then Maddy is offered the chance to become a Guardian. This means entering into dangerous and high stakes training, with no guarantee that she can succeed, and with a host of jealous full-blood Angels undermining her every move. More than that, it means leaving her mortal life behind - forever - and allying with the Angels at a time when their relationship with humans has never been more volatile. When an anti-Angel bombing kills dozens of innocent people, it sets into motion a chain of events that will turn the city of Angels into a city of turmoil. Maddy and Jacks must choose sides... even if that choice makes them enemies.
