7736182:::::The Lost Hero:::::Jason has a problem . He doesn t remember anything before waking up in a bus full of kids on a field trip. Apparently he has a girlfriend named Piper, and a best friend named Leo. They re all students at a boarding school for bad kids. What did Jason do to end up here? And where is here, exactly? Piper has a secret . Her father has been missing for three days, ever since she had that terrifying nightmare about his being in trouble. Piper doesn t understand her dream, or why her boyfriend suddenly doesn t recognize her. When a freak storm hits during the school trip, unleashing strange creatures and whisking her, Jason, and Leo away to someplace called Camp Half-Blood, she has a feeling she s going to find out. Leo has a way with tools . When he sees his cabin at Camp Half-Blood, filled with power tools and machine parts, he feels right at home. But there s weird stuff, too like the curse everyone keeps talking about, and some camper who's gone missing. Weirdest of all, his bunkmates insist that each of them including Leo is related to a god . Does this have anything to do with Jason's amnesia, or the fact that Leo keeps seeing ghosts?
