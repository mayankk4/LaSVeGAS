11777020:::::Headhunters:::::Roger Brown is a corporate headhunter, and he s a master of his profession. But one career simply can t support his luxurious lifestyle and his wife s fledgling art gallery. At an art opening one night he meets Clas Greve, who is not only the perfect candidate for a major CEO job, but also, perhaps, the answer to his financial woes: Greve just so happens to mention that he owns a priceless Peter Paul Rubens painting that s been lost since World War II and Roger Brown just so happens to dabble in art theft. But when he breaks into Greve s apartment, he finds more than just the painting. And Clas Greve may turn out to be the worst thing that s ever happened to Roger Brown.
