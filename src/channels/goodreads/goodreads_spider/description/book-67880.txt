67880:::::The Outsider:::::Librarian note: an alternate cover for this edition can be found here . The Outsider is the seminal work on alienation, creativity &amp; the modern mind-set. First published over forty years ago, it made its youthful author England's most controversial intellectual. The Outsider is an individual engaged in an intense self-exploration-a person who lives at the edge, challenges cultural values &amp; "stands for Truth." Born into a world without perspective, where others simply drift thru life, the Outsider creates his own set of rules &amp; lives them in an unsympathetic environment. The relative handful of people who fulfilled Wilson's definition of the Outsider in the 1950s have now become a significant social force, making Wilson's vision more relevant today than ever. Thru the works &amp; lives of various artists--including Kafka, Camus, Eliot, Hemingway, Hesse, Lawrence, Van Gogh, Nijinsky, Shaw, Blake, Nietzsche &amp; Dostoyevski--Wilson explores the psyche of the Outsider, his effect on society &amp; society's effect on him. Wilson illuminates the struggle of those who seek not only the transformation of Self but also the transformation of society as a whole. The book is essential for everyone who shares his conviction that "a new religion is needed".
