13505670:::::Krampus: The Yule Lord:::::Set in Appalachia, Krampus the Yule Lord is a twisted fairytale about a failed West Virginia songwriter who gets ensnared on Christmas Eve in an eternal war between a not-so-saintly Saint Nick and his dark enemy Krampus, aka Black Peter, an ancient trickster demon. Krampus the Yule Lord is Gregory Maguire ( Wicked ) meets Susanna Clarke ( Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell ) in the realm of Guillermo Del Toro s Pan s Labyrinth , as Clive Barker ( Mr. B. Gone ) works his dark sorcery from the shadows. Once again featuring Brom s chillingly beautiful artwork throughout, Krampus the Yule Lord is a feast of wonder straight from the kitchen of Sweeney Todd.
