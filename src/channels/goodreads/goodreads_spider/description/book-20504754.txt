When he finds a beautiful young woman in his pit trap, it s obvious to him that she is meant to be his mate. He doesn t know where she came from; she s wearing some pretty odd clothing, and she makes a lot of noises with her mouth that give him a headache. Still, he s determined to fulfill his purpose in life provide for her, protect her, and put a baby in her. Elizabeth doesn t know where she is or exactly how she got there. She s confused and distressed by her predicament, and there s a caveman hauling her back to his cavehome.
