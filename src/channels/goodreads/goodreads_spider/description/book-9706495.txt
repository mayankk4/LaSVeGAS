9706495:::::Time of Death:::::From the #1 New York Times bestselling author: three popular Eve Dallas stories together for the first time in one volume. J. D. Robb's In Death novels have been praised as "Law &amp; Order: SVU-in the future" ( Entertainment Weekly ). Now, together for the first time in one volume, are three stories that spotlight Lieutenant Eve Dallas doing what she does best: solving crime with skill, integrity, and passion. Eternity in Death A seductive killer is luring in victims with a promise of the impossible-immortality. Eve Dallas must strip away the fantasy to catch the coldhearted madman. Ritual in Death Eve is plunged into the violent aftermath of a ritualistic murder-and into the mind of an alleged witness who can't remember a thing to save his life. Missing in Death When a woman disappears from a New York City ferry, it's a case that only Eve Dallas can solve- because the woman didn't jump, and yet she's not on board.
