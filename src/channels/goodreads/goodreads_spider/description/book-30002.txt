30002:::::The Dain Curse:::::Everything about the Leggett diamond heist indicated to the Continental Op that it was an inside job. From the stray diamond found in the yard to the eyewitness accounts of a "strange man" casing the house, everything was just too pat. Gabrielle Dain-Leggett has enough secrets to fill a closet, and when she disappears shortly after the robbery, she becomes the Op's prime suspect.

Before he can solve the riddle of the diamond theft, the Continental Op must first solve the mystery of this strange family.
