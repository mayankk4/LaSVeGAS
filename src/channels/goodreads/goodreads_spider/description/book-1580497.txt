1580497:::::The Fisherman:::::Few New Testament characters are as fascinating as Simon Barjona, the man called Peter-a reluctant disciple who changed the face of Christianity. For more than twenty-five years, author and pastor Larry Huntsperger has spent hundreds of hours studying New Testament documents in preparation for writing this fictional first-person account of the life of this enigmatic disciple. The result is a novel that faithfully follows Scripture while offering a powerful, fresh narration of the story of one of Christianity's greatest men. In the fast-paced chapters of The Fisherman , readers will relive Peter's initial resistance to the pull he feels toward Jesus and his ministry. They'll walk with Peter alongside Jesus through the events of the Gospels and catch intimate glimpses of the disciples' personalities. They'll even "feel" the dust on the roads as familiar stories are transformed into original, spellbinding accounts from Peter's life. This fascinating novel will help readers "to see the Master as a man. For, if we cannot see him correctly as man, we have no hope of understanding him correctly as our God."
