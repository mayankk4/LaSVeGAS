But she is hiding a secret a secret that will bring everlasting shame to her family should it ever come to light. A merrybegot and a minister s daughter two girls who could not have less in common. Yet their fates collide when Grace and her younger sister, Patience, are suddenly spitting pins, struck with fits, and speaking in fevered tongues.
