18193684:::::The Fig Orchard:::::The unforgettable, deeply moving story of a woman splintered by war and cultural mores, desperately struggling to hold her family together, THE FIG ORCHARD is a rich, compelling epic of love, heroism, family and empowerment. In an isolated, tradition-bound village high above the Jordan River, balancing delicately amidst age-old superstitions and religious orthodoxy, Nisrina Huniah, a fifteen-year-old girl, is torn between innocent imaginings and looming apprehensions as she marries a man she has never met only to fall in love on the night they are wed. Her joy, short-lived, takes a heart-wrenching turn when the encroaching World War fiercely shatters her reality, propelling her on an unexpected journey where she develops unlikely friendships that ultimately alter her perception of herself and the world around her. Beautifully written in rich, elegant prose, this sweeping epic of love and friendship, longing, and the hope of redemption is woven into a colorful tapestry that comes alive against the vibrant backdrop of life in early twentieth-century Middle East. With its haunting and deeply affecting ending, THE FIG ORCHARD will remain in the hearts and minds of its readers long after the last page is turned.
