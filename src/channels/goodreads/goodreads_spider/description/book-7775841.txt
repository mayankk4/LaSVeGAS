7775841:::::Sleepwalk With Me and Other Painfully True Stories:::::Hello, I am Mike Birbiglia and I want you to read my book. Too on the nose? Sorry. Let me dial it back. I m Mike Birbiglia and I m a comedian. You may know me from Comedy Central or This American Life or The Bob &amp; Tom Show , but you ve never seen me like this before. Naked. Wait, that s the name of another book. Also I m not naked as there are no pictures in my book. Also, if there were naked pictures of me, you definitely wouldn t buy it, though you might sneak a copy into the back corner of the bookstore and show it to your friend and laugh. Okay, let s get off the naked stuff. This is my first book. It s difficult to describe. It s a comedic memoir, but I m only 32 years old so I d hate for you to think I m wrapping it up, so to speak. But I tell some personal stories. Some REALLY personal stories. Stories that I considered not publishing time and time again, especially when my father said, Michael, you might want to stay away from the per sonal stuff. I said, Dad, just read the dedication. (Which I m telling you to do too.) Some of the stories are about my childhood, some are about girls I made out with when I was thirteen, some are about my parents, and some are, of course, about my bouts with sleepwalking. Bring this book to bed. And sleepwalk with me.
