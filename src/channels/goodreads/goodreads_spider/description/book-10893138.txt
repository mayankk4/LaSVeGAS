10893138:::::The Time of My Life:::::Lucy Silchester has an appointment with her life and she s going to have to keep it. Lying on Lucy Silchester s carpet one day when she returns from work is a gold envelope. Inside is an invitation to a meeting with Life. Her life. It turns out she's been ignoring it and it needs to meet with her face to face. It sounds peculiar, but Lucy s read about this in a magazine. Anyway, she can t make the date: she s much too busy despising her job, skipping out on her friends and avoiding her family. But Lucy s life isn t what it seems. Some of the choices she s made and stories she s told aren t what they seem either. From the moment she meets the man who introduces himself as her life, her stubborn half-truths are going to be revealed in all their glory unless Lucy learns to tell the truth about what really matters to her.
