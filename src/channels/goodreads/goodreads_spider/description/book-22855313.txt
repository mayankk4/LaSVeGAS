22855313:::::Arkadia:::::I am Arkadia Castner. I am beautiful. I am popular. I am also the most messed-up witch you will ever meet. I can t make water boil, or make the wind blow; I can t even light a match without the aid of a flint. My 18th birthday is in six months, and if I don t pass the Paranormal Safety Exams (PSEs) by then, I will be banished to the Isle of Shadows for eternity, never to be seen again it will be as though I never existed. I found myself at the halfway house under the supervision and guidance of Den Mother and telepathic empath, Eloise Mayflower. The halfway house is the last chance for troubled paranormal teens like me to pass our PSEs and avoid banishment. Eloise knows everything I think and feel, and is supposed to be helping me, but I still can t do basic spells a six-year-old can do. I hate it here, but I have no choice. This is my last chance. I had all but given up hope, when in walks Bohdan Drak. Tall, dark, and so damn sexy it hurts to look at him even his muscles had muscles. He is a dragon shifter and wears the mark of having passed his PSEs. When our souls meet, we realize we have found our soul mates and perfect matches. My dying hope has found life again, and I finally have a reason to look forward to a future. I thought everything would be fine, but darkness and despair creep into my future. I have been framed for a murder, and everyone believes I am guilty. The paranormal council now watches my every move. Can I trust Bohdan and true love? I fear my destiny is to be banished forever
