2086132:::::What It Is:::::How do objects summon memories? What do real images feel like? For decades, these types of questions have permeated the pages of Lynda Barry s compositions, with words attracting pictures and conjuring places through a pen that first and foremost keeps on moving. What It Is demonstrates a tried-and-true creative method that is playful, powerful, and accessible to anyone with an inquisitive wish to write or to remember. Composed of completely new material, each page of Barry s first Drawn &amp; Quarterly book is a full-color collage that is not only a gentle guide to this process but an invigorating example of exactly what it is: The ordinary is extraordinary.
