33652251:::::The Empress:::::It s a new day in the Empire. Tyrus has ascended to the throne with Nemesis by his side and now they can find a new way forward one where they don t have to hide or scheme or kill. One where creatures like Nemesis will be given worth and recognition, where science and information can be shared with everyone and not just the elite. But having power isn t the same thing as keeping it, and change isn t always welcome. The ruling class, the Grandiloquy, has held control over planets and systems for centuries and they are plotting to stop this teenage Emperor and Nemesis, who is considered nothing more than a creature and certainly not worthy of being Empress. Nemesis will protect Tyrus at any cost. He is the love of her life, and they are partners in this new beginning. But she cannot protect him by being the killing machine she once was. She will have to prove the humanity that she s found inside herself to the whole Empire or she and Tyrus may lose more than just the throne. But if proving her humanity means that she and Tyrus must do inhuman things, is the fight worth the cost of winning it?
