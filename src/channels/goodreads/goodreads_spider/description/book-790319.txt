790319:::::Bad Kitty:::::1 Meet Jasmine, 2 forensic supersleuth, 3 aspiring Model Daughter, 4 and friend to animals. 5 One second she's trying to enjoy her Vegas Vacation, 6 the next she's tangled up in an outrageous adventure and has to outwit a crazed killer before he ends ten lives, one of them her own. 1 Hi! That's me! 2 I. Wish. 3 Emphasis on aspiring. Current status: failing. 4 If friend means "unsuspecting victim" and animals means "one very bad kitty." 5 And meet the cute guy at the Snack Hut. I have priorities. 6 Meep! But I guess it winds up okay since Kirkus Reviews says: "Inventive, witty, and laugh-out-loud funny, with an enjoyably twisty ending." They wouldn't say that if everyone died, right? Right?
