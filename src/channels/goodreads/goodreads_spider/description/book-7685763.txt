7685763:::::Indulgence in Death:::::NYPSD Lieutenant Eve Dallas must discover who's preying on those who cater to the rich and famous in the new novel by #1 New York Times bestselling author J.D. Robb. When a murder disrupts the Irish vacation she is taking with her husband, Roarke, Eve realizes that no place is safe not an Irish wood or the streets of the manic city she calls home. But nothing prepares her for what she discovers upon her return to the cop shop in New York. A limo driver is shot through the neck with a crossbow. Then a high-priced escort is found stabbed through the heart with a bayonet. Eve begins to fear she has come across that most dangerous of criminal: a thrill-killer, and one with a taste for the finer things in life and death. As time runs out on another innocent victim's life, Eve's investigation will take her into the rarified circle that her husband, Roarke, travels in and into the perverted heart of madness.
