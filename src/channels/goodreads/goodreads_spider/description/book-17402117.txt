In his warped mind, the seven deadly sins were the downfall of society. To punish the guilty, he created the Hole, a place where sinners are branded according to their sins.

Now, LUST wraps around my neck like thick, blue fingers, threatening to choke the life out of me. I ve been accused of a crime I didn t commit, and the Hole is my new home. Constant darkness. Brutal and savage violence. Excruciating pain. Every day is a fight for survival. But I won t let them win. I will not die in the Hole. I am more than my brand. I m a fighter. My name is Lexi Hamilton, and this is my story.
