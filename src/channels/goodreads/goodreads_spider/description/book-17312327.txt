17312327:::::Last Days:::::Have you ever heard of Sister Katherine and the Temple of the Last Days? Independent filmmaker Kyle Freeman is desperate, fearing that the right project will never come up. But when Maximillian Solomon asks him about The Temple of the Last Days he figures his luck might be about to change. In 1975 the cult led by its infamous leader Sister Katherine met a bloody end in the Arizona desert. The shoot s locations take Kyle to the cult s original bases in London, France and finally the crime scene where the cult met their bloody end. But when he interviews the remaining survivors of the Last Days who haven t broken silence in decades, a series of uncanny events and unexplained phenomena plague the shoots. And what exactly is it they are managing to record in any place the Temple once resided? Troubling out-of-body experiences and nocturnal visitations, the sudden demise of their interviewees and the discovery of ghastly artefacts, soon pitch Kyle and his one-man crew, into the unnerving realisation that they have become entangled in the cult s hideous legacy.
