She swooped in, making me smile. But then she left, taking my next breath with her. Her smile could light up a room, making my black heart pitter patter. I found her again ten years later, with a syringe in her arm. Blood coming from her legs. She was broken and I was glad she was broken. She wouldn't think less of me and my damaged ways.
