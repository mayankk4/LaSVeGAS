The Bad Death of Eduard Delacroix : Time has run out for one of the inmates at the Cold Mountain penitentiary. Eduard Delacroix is set to take that final walk down the Green Mile. But first he must say good-bye -- to the guards, to his fellow inmates, and to a strange creature that forever changed his life.
