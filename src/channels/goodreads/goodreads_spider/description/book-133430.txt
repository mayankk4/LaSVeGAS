133430:::::Centennial:::::Written to commemorate the Bicentennial in 1976, James A. Michener s magnificent saga of the West is an enthralling celebration of the frontier. Brimming with the glory of America s past, the story of Colorado the Centennial State is manifested through its people: Lame Beaver, the Arapaho chieftain and warrior, and his Comanche and Pawnee enemies; Levi Zendt, fleeing with his child bride from the Amish country; the cowboy, Jim Lloyd, who falls in love with a wealthy and cultured Englishwoman, Charlotte Seccombe. In Centennial, trappers, traders, homesteaders, gold seekers, ranchers, and hunters are brought together in the dramatic conflicts that shape the destiny of the legendary West and the entire country.
