33555224:::::Thunderhead:::::Rowan and Citra take opposite stances on the morality of the Scythedom, putting them at odds, in the second novel of the chilling New York Times bestselling series from Neal Shusterman, author of the Unwind dystology. Rowan has gone rogue, and has taken it upon himself to put the Scythedom through a trial by fire. Literally. In the year since Winter Conclave, he has gone off-grid, and has been striking out against corrupt scythes not only in MidMerica, but across the entire continent. He is a dark folk hero now Scythe Lucifer a vigilante taking down corrupt scythes in flames. Citra, now a junior scythe under Scythe Curie, sees the corruption and wants to help change it from the inside out, but is thwarted at every turn, and threatened by the new order scythes. Realizing she cannot do this alone or even with the help of Scythe Curie and Faraday, she does the unthinkable, and risks being deadish so she can communicate with the Thunderhead the only being on earth wise enough to solve the dire problems of a perfect world. But will it help solve those problems, or simply watch as perfection goes into decline?
