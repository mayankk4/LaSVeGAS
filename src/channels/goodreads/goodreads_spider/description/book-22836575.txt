22836575:::::99 Days:::::Day 1: Julia Donnelly eggs my house my first night back in Star Lake, and that s how I know everyone still remembers everything how I destroyed my relationship with Patrick the night everything happened with his brother, Gabe. How I wrecked their whole family. Now I m serving out my summer like a jail sentence: Just ninety-nine days till I can leave for college, and be done. Day 4: A nasty note on my windshield makes it clear Julia isn t finished. I m expecting a fight when someone taps me on the shoulder, but it s just Gabe, home from college and actually happy to see me. For what it s worth, Molly Barlow, he says, I m really glad you re back. Day 12: Gabe got me to come to this party, and I m actually having fun. I think he s about to kiss me and that s when I see Patrick. My Patrick, who s supposed to be clear across the country. My Patrick, who s never going to forgive me.
