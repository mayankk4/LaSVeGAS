6054449:::::Dork Diaries Book 1: Tales from a Not-So-Fabulous Life:::::It s Diary of a Wimpy Kid for girls in this hilarious novel! Meet Nikki Maxwell! She's starting eighth grade at a new school and her very first diary packed with hilarious stories and art in Book One of the #1 New York Times bestselling Dork Diaries series! New school. New mean girl. New crush. New diary so I can spill about all of it I put a lot of really personal stuff in this diary along with my sketches and doodles. But, mostly it s about how TRAUMATIC it was transferring to my new private middle school, Westchester Country Day. And, how a lot of the CCP (Cool, Cute &amp; Popular) kids were really SNOBBY and made my life TOTALLY miserable. People like, oh, I don t know, maybe MACKENZIE HOLLISTER!! And, it just so happened that I got stuck with a locker right next to hers. I could NOT believe I had such CRAPPY luck. I knew right then and there it was going to be a VERY, VERY long school year :-( !
