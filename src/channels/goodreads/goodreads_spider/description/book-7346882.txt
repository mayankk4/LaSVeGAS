An aristocratic woman, fleeing the Louvre, takes a wrong turn and loses her way in the nameless streets of the Left Bank. For want of a map there were no reliable ones at the time Marie-Antoinette will go to the guillotine. Baudelaire, Baron Haussmann, the real-life Mimi of La Boh me , Proust, Charles de Gaulle (who is suspected of having faked an assassination attempt on himself in Notre Dame) these and many more are Robb s cast of characters.
