13517444:::::Stung:::::There is no cure for being stung. Fiona doesn t remember going to sleep. But when she awakens, her world no longer exists. Her house is abandoned and broken. Her neighborhood is barren and dead. And there is a tattoo on her right hand. A tattoo Fiona doesn t remember getting but somehow she must conceal at any cost. Because humanity has been divided. Those bearing the tattoo have turned into mindless, violent beasts that roam the streets and sewers, preying upon the unbranded, while a select few live protected inside a fortresslike wall, their lives devoted to rebuilding society and killing all who bear the mark. And Fiona has awoken branded, on the wrong side of the wall, and normal. From the author of Shifting comes this remarkable reimagining of Sleeping Beauty , where the sting of a bee, rather than the prick of a needle, can destroy the world.
