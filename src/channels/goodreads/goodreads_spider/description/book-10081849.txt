With all the practical suggestions built on a firm gospel foundation, this book will help you flourish in the essential skills necessary for a balanced reading diet of Scripture, serious works of theology, and moving devotional works, but without overlooking the importance of how-to books from expert practitioners, the storytelling genius of historians, and rich novels written by skilled artists of fiction. Literature scholar Leland Ryken calls Lit! a triumph of scholarship, but mostly it s a practical and unpretentious book about the most urgent skills you need to enjoy a luminously literate life in honor of God.
