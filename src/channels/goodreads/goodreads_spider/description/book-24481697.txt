24481697:::::Map of Fates:::::Two weeks. That s how long it took for Avery West s ordinary life to change forever: In two weeks, she discovered she was heiress to a powerful secret society known as the Circle, learned her mother was taken hostage by the Circle s enemies, and fell for a boy she s not allowed to love, just as she found out another was her unwelcome destiny. Now, Avery crosses oceans in private jets to hunt for clues that will uncover the truth about the Circle, setting her mom and herself free before it s too late. By her side are both the boys: Jack steady, loyal, and determined to help her even at the expense of his own duty and Stellan, whose connection to Avery grows stronger by the day despite her best intentions, making her question what she believes at every turn. But at the end of a desperate hunt from the islands of Greece to the red carpet at Cannes comes a discovery that not only changes everything, but could bring the whole world to its knees. And now Avery is forced to face the truth: in the world of the Circle, no one is what they seem.
