3212989:::::A Red-Tainted Silence:::::I'll never forget the first time I saw him--the wild shock of black hair, the beautiful blue eyes, the full lips with that perfected pout. Such a diva, even from the beginning. I was entranced, smitten, mesmerized. He had the face of an angel, and the voice of one, too--and almost from the start I began the pattern of losing Nicholas. I was good at that--I guess I never believed I really deserved him, what he would bring to us both. What we would experience, because of him. What we could be, because of him. What I could be because of the strength and belief he had in me. Denial denial denial. Damn, I was good at that. But I was going to have to get good at trust and acceptance, if I wanted to keep him.
