8081589:::::Falling From Grace:::::When you wake up in the morning and your eyes take in the first hints of light that shine through your window, the dust motes catching and reflecting the sun s rays like little diamonds, the shimmering hues of yellow and orangey gold breaking through into your room, the first thing you think about usually isn t how you re going to make it through the worst day of your life. Unfortunately for Grace Shelley, that s exactly what she s facing as she ponders what to do now that she s going to be starting out her last year in high school without her best friend. She s not exactly the most popular girl in school - well, not the most popular girl in school to like, anyway - and everything seems to be hinting at another status quo year for her until she bumps into a stranger who leaves her stumbling for words and chasing after her heart. The new guy in school is different. Robert doesn t care about the rumors he s heard about her or that no one else seems to see her the same way that he does; he only wants to be her friend. That s when things get complicated. When Grace learns that he s not your typical high school boy and that he s actually a wingless angel who s looking for someone to trust, she s thrust into his world where not all angels are meant to protect human beings, and where the changes she brings into his life changes everything in hers.
