17912521:::::Second Chances:::::This book has been re-published as "The Heart of Falcon Ridge . It is now a part of "The McLendon Family Saga and no longer available in print/eBook formats. HEAT WARNING: Second Chances is an erotic romance containing sex, m nage, cowboys who like to talk dirty, and some violence. Oh, and absolutely no action between brothers, because that would just be awkward. Six years after the McLendon brothers lost their wife during the birth of their twins they are merely existing. Focused only on running their ranch and raising their boys, finding another woman to share their hearts with isn't even a dot on their map...until Claira Robbins drops into their family like a baby bird falling from its nest. She certainly ruffles more than a few feathers. Matt and Mason believe she is the one who will heal their hearts and their family. Their older brother Grey? He plans to live the rest of his life comfortably numb from the neck down, even if it kills him...and it just might if Claira's lethal past catches up to her. Can they convince Grey to let go of the past and give love a second chance? Or will his own haunting secret destroy what is left of their family for good?
