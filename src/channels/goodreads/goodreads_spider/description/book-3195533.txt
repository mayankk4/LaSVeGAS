3195533:::::The Horror Stories of Robert E. Howard:::::Here are Howard s greatest horror tales, all in their original, definitive versions. Some of Howard s best-known characters Solomon Kane, Bran Mak Morn, and sailor Steve Costigan among them roam the forbidding locales of the author s fevered imagination, from the swamps and bayous of the Deep South to the fiend-haunted woods outside Paris to remote jungles in Africa. The collection includes Howard s masterpiece Pigeons from Hell, which Stephen King calls one of the finest horror stories of [the twentieth] century, a tale of two travelers who stumble upon the ruins of a Southern plantation and into the maw of its fatal secret. In Black Canaan even the best warrior has little chance of taking down the evil voodoo man with unholy powers and none at all against his wily mistress, the diabolical High Priestess of Damballah. In these and other lavishly illustrated classics, such as the revenge nightmare Worms of the Earth and The Cairn on the Headland, Howard spins tales of unrelenting terror, the legacy of one of the world s great masters of the macabre.
