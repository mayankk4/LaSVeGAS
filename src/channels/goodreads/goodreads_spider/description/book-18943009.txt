18943009:::::Rock Bottom:::::Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found here Their love had the power of a runaway freight train, and the potential to be just as destructive. The tempestuous sequel to Bad Things picks up where the first book left off. Reeling from a profound loss, Tristan and Danika struggle to pick up the pieces and build a life together, but the hard habits of a lifetime are not so easy to escape. Rock Bottom takes us on a dual point of view journey through addiction and desire, through love and agony, and answers the question we ve been asking since these characters were introduced in Grounded: What happened between Tristan and Danika? DANIKA Even love couldn t cushion a fall like ours. My love for Tristan was so big that I felt consumed by it, and even so, it was not enough to overpower our combined demons. I struggled. I yelled and screamed. I scratched and kicked. I fought like hell, but even the most determined fighters have to stop before they break. No one could say I didn t fight for him. I love you, I spoke softly into his ear. He gripped me harder. I can t ever lose you, Danika. I m not sure I d survive it. You ve got me. And I m not going anywhere. Not ever. I meant the words when I said them, but life had other plans for us. I d have given my life for that fight. In fact, I very nearly did. TRISTAN She was the one. If I d ever had a doubt, I didn t now. She was the one I d be thinking about, longing for, until I took my last breath. If I lost her tomorrow, I d pine for her like a lovesick fool. This was the kind of love that only hit you once in your life. This book is intended for readers 18 and up.
