7704979:::::Love You to Death / High Stakes:::::I can see ghosts. I can talk to ghosts. And, if necessary, I can kick some serious ghost butt. Susannah Simon has an unearthly gift: she's a Mediator. She must help trapped and tortured souls move on to the next world. But not all spooks want her guidance or want to go quietly - that's when Suze has to get tough. Then she meets Jesse, a drop-dead-gorgeous ghost who just happens to haunt her bedroom. It's hard to boot a guy into the afterlife when he makes your heart beat faster - even though he's been dead for 150 years...
