13260207:::::My Country 'Tis of Thee:::::The first Muslim to be elected to Congress speaks out about what divides Americans and what can bring us together. As a former Catholic who converted to Islam, Keith Ellison, is the first Muslim elected to Congress from a district with fewer than 1 percent Muslims and 11 percent Blacks. With his unique perspective on uniting a disparate community and speaking to a common goal, Ellison takes a provocative look at America and what needs to change to accommodate different races and beliefs. Filled with anecdotes, statistics, and social commentary, Ellison touches on everything from the Tea Party to Obama, from race to the immigration debate and more. He also draws some very clear distinctions between parties and shows why the deep polarization is unhealthy for America. Deeply patriotic, with My Country Tis of Thee , Ellison strives to help define what it means to be an American today.
