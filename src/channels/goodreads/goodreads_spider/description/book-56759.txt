56759:::::The Mayor of Casterbridge:::::I ve not always been what I am now In a fit of drunken anger, Michael Henchard sells his wife and baby daughter for five guineas at a country fair. Over the course of the following years, he manages to establish himself as a respected and prosperous pillar of the community of Casterbridge, but behind his success there always lurk the shameful secret of his past and a personality prone to self-destructive pride and temper. Subtitled A Story of a Man of Character , Hardy s powerful and sympathetic study of the heroic but deeply flawed Henchard is also an intensely dramatic work, tragically played out against the vivid backdrop of a close-knit Dorsetshire town. This edition includes an introduction, chronology of Hardy s life and works, the illustrations for the original Serial Issue, place names, maps, glossary, full explanatory notes as well as Hardy s prefaces to the 1895 and 1912 editions.
