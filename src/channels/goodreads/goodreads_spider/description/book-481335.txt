481335:::::The Vision:::::DON'T CLOSE YOUR EYES... He's watching you. He knows what you're doing. He knows what you're thinking. He's coming after you. DON'T CLOSE YOUR EYES... He has a knife. The steel blade gleams. Whenever you close your eyes, you can see it--the tip of his knife, pointing at your chest. DON'T CLOSE YOUR EYES... He's closing them for you. "A master of sheer fright... the tension never lets up, building page by page to a nail-biting, hair-raising finale!" --Florida Times-Union
