32310231:::::Devil's Slave:::::I thought I knew what hell was. After years as a cop, I was sure I'd seen the worst humanity had to offer. I had no f*cking idea. Now I know I've seen hell. Hell is the basement of an industrial warehouse where the rich, bored and psychotic buy their pleasure at the cost of innocent men and women. I will take these bastards down, but first, I have to let myself be sold My life as a sexual slave should destroy me. Maybe I'm made for hell because as much as I want to end Domingo Morgan and his sick empire, I can't wait for the next moment I feel his hands on my throat. Every day I spend as his property, I crave him a little bit more. Lover. Cop. Victim. Damned if I know who I am anymore. My life as Hugh Kincaid, police officer, is over. The only thing that means anything, the only thing that matters now, is that I belong to him. Lola Hale explores your darkest erotic fantasies in DEVIL'S SLAVE, the first book in her addictive male/male American Monsters trilogy.
