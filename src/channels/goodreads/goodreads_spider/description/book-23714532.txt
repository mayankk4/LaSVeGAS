23714532:::::Beautiful Sacrifice:::::Falyn Fairchild can walk away from anything. Having already left her car, her education, and even her parents, the daughter of the next governor of Colorado is back in her hometown, broke and waiting tables for the Bucksaw Caf . After every shift, Falyn adds to her shoebox of cash, hoping to one day save enough to buy her a plane ticket to the only place she can find forgiveness: Eakins, Illinois. The moment Taylor Maddox is seated in Falyn s section at the Bucksaw, she knows he s trouble. Taylor is charming, breaks promises, and gorgeous even when covered in filth making him everything Falyn believes a hotshot firefighter to be. Falyn isn t interested in becoming another statistic, and for a Maddox boy, a disinterested girl is the ultimate challenge. Once Falyn learns where Taylor calls home, everything changes. In the end, Maddox persistence is met with Falyn s talent for leaving, and for the first time, Taylor may be the one to get burned.
