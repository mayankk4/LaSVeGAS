170529:::::What My Mother Doesn't Know:::::My name is Sophie. This book is about me. It tells the heart-stoppingly riveting story of my first love. And also of my second. And, okay, my third love, too. It's not that I'm boy crazy. It's just that even though I'm almost fifteen it's like my mind and my body and my heart just don't seem to be able to agree on anything.
