Dante is only thirty-six but already feared and respected in the Familia, and he s notorious for always getting what he wants. Valentina is terrified of the wedding night that might reveal her secret, but her worries prove unfounded when Dante shows her the cold shoulder. Soon her fear is replaced by confusion and indignation. Valentina is tired of being ignored. She s determined to get Dante s attention and desire, even if she can t get his heart that still belongs to his dead wife. ** Book #2 in the "Born in Blood Mafia Chronicles".
