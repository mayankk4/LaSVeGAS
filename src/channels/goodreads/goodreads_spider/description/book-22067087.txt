22067087:::::Be My Hero:::::Once upon a time, there was this pampered rich girl who was kind of full of herself. She really only cared about appearances and hiding all her dark, ugly secrets under the guise of an opinionated snob. But then Eva Mercer got pregnant, shot by a psycho, and kicked out of the only home she knew. Now she s broke, unemployed, and has to start anew with a newborn to raise. But how? On the other side of town, sexy, tattooed orphan, Patrick Ryan, can t get a break. He s out on parole for defending the last damsel in distress while trying to help her support her child, but all he wants is to find his one true love. He knows this woman by scent, smile, and laugh, but he s never actually met her. He doesn t even know her name. He just knows she s the key to fixing everything. One kind of hero can save you from physical harm. Another can rescue you from a different kind of doom. To reach their dreams, Eva and Pick can save each other. But first, they must open their hearts and learn how to trust.
