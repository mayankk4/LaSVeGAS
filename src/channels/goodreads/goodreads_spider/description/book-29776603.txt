29776603:::::Edna in the Desert:::::Can a Beverly Hills teen survive without a smart phone, Internet, and TV? Edna will find out. Edna is thirteen, a precocious troublemaker wreaking havoc at her Beverly Hills school. Her therapist advocates medication, but her parents come up with an alternative cure: Edna will spend the summer in the desert with her grandparents. Their remote cabin is cut off from cell phone service, Internet and television. Edna s determined to rebel until she meets an older local boy and falls in love for the first time. How can she get to know him from the edge of nowhere? Praise for Edna in the Desert I loved this realistic, funny-and-yet-equally-serious, pitch-perfect novel about a young teen with no distractions other than herself. What Edna learns over her summer in the desert makes for one of my favorite books of the year. Melissa Senate Author of See Jane Date and The Mosts
