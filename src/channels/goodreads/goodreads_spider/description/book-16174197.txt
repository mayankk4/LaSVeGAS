16174197:::::Knight & Play:::::There's only one thing in life Lucien Knight really hates, and that's husbands who cheat on their wives. There's only one problem in Sophie Black's life. Her cheating husband... From the moment Lucien &amp; Sophie meet, the seal is set. Romantic, emotional &amp; intensely erotic, Knight and Play is the perfect read for lovers of international bestsellers Fifty Shades &amp; Bared To You . Let yourself be swept away by Part One of the Knight series from Kitty French, a romance so hot it'll burn your fingers... CEO of Knight Inc. Lucien Knight is catch-your-breath gorgeous and damaged by his troubled past in Norway. All grown up and relocated to London, he's built his empire of adult clubs from the ground up to become the gorgeous patron saint of the sex industry. No one knows the dark childhood secrets that have given Lucien a backbone of steel and a heart encased in ice. No one until Sophie Black, that is... From the moment girl-next-door Sophie accepts the job as Lucien Knight's PA, she understands how Alice must have felt when she tumbled down the rabbit hole. Lucien takes her safe, vanilla life away and plunges her head first into a huge dish of fantasy flavours. Rich, spicy chocolate covered with dark, oozingly lickable sauce? Check. Tutti-frutti with indecently red, glistening cherries on the top? Yes please. Lucien strips away all of Sophie's inhibitions, and when he instructs her to select three new toys, she soon realises he has more than a game of Monopoly on his mind... He's opened the door to a whole new pleasure packed world without limits, and Sophie is utterly intoxicated. But how far is she willing to go? And what happens when she has to step back into reality again? Lucien &amp; Sophie's is a story of star crossed love and forbidden passion, a sexual odyssey that spans the globe and changes both of their lives forever. Let it change yours, too.
