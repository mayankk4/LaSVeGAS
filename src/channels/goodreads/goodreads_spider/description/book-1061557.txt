1061557:::::Riding Freedom:::::Charlotte Parkhurst is raised in an orphanage for boys, which suits her just fine. She doesn t like playing with dolls, she can hold her own in a fight, and she loves to work in the stables. Charlotte has a way with horses and wants to spend her life training and riding them on a ranch of her own. The problem is, as a girl in the mid-1800s, Charlotte is expected to live a much different life one without freedom. But Charlotte is smart and determined, and she figures out a way to live her dreams with a plan so clever and so secret almost no one figures it out.
