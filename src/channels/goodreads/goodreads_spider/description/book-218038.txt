218038:::::All About Love:::::Alasdair Cynster known to his intimates as Lucifer decides to rusticate in the country before the matchmaking skills of London s mamas become firmly focused on him, the last unwed Cynster. But an escape to Devonshire leads him straight to his destiny in the irresistible form of Phyllida Tallent, a willful, independent beauty of means who brings all his masterful Cynster instincts rioting to the fore. Lucifer isn t about to deny his desire for Phyllida, and he s determined to use all his seductive skills to enjoy the benefits of destiny s choice without submitting to the parson s noose. Phyllida has had a bevy of suitors, her charm and wit are well known throughout the countryside, but none of them has tempted her the way Lucifer does. His offer to teach her all about the ways of love is almost too tantalising to resist. And though she s not yet completely surrendered, she knows only a fool stands against a Cynster...and Phyllida is no one s fool.
