21849362:::::The Shadows:::::Trez Latimer doesn t really exist. And not just because the identity was created so that a Shadow could function in the underbelly of the human world. Sold by his parents to the Queen of the S Hsibe as a child, Trez escaped the Territory and has been a pimp and an enforcer in Caldwell, NY for years- all the while on the run from a destiny of sexual servitude. He s never had anyone he could totally rely on... except for his brother, iAm. iAm s sole goal has always been to keep his brother from self-destructing- and he knows he s failed. It s not until the Chosen Serena enters Trez s life that the male begins to turn things around... but by then it s too late. The pledge to mate the Queen s daughter comes due and there is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, and no negotiating. Trapped between his heart and a fate he never volunteered for, Trez must decide whether to endanger himself and others- or forever leave behind the female he s in love with. But then an unimaginable tragedy strikes and changes everything. Staring out over an emotional abyss, Trez must find a reason to go on or risk losing himself and his soul forever. And iAm, in the name of brotherly love, is faced with making the ultimate sacrifice...
