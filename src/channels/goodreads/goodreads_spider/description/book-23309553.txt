23309553:::::Ruthless:::::Ruth Carver has always competed like her life depends on it. Ambitious. Tough. Maybe even mean. It s no wonder people call her ruthless. When she wakes up with a concussion in the bed of a moving pickup truck, Ruth realizes she has been entered into a contest she can t afford to lose. At a remote, rotting cabin deep in the Blue Ridge Mountains, Ruth s blindfold comes off and she finds herself face-to-face with her captor: A man who believes his mission is to punish bad girls like Ruth. A man who has done this six times before. The other girls were never heard from again, but Ruth won t go down easy. She escapes into the wilderness, but her hunter is close at her heels. That s when the real battle begins. That s when Ruth must decides just how far she ll go in order to survive. Back home, they called her Ruthless. They had no idea just how right they were.
