Before the sun rises, the town will be under full assault, the opening objective in the new Victor Frankenstein s trajectory of ultimate destruction. Deucalion Victor s first, haunted creation saw his maker die in New Orleans two years earlier. Yet an unshakable intuition tells him that Victor lives and is at work again. Within hours Deucalion will come together with his old allies, detectives Carson O Connor and Michael Maddison, Victor s engineered wife, Erika Five, and her companion Jocko to confront new peril. Others will gather around them. But this time Victor has a mysterious, powerful new backer, and he and his army are more formidable, their means and intentions infinitely more deadly, than ever before.
