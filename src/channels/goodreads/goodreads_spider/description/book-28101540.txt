28101540:::::Under Rose-Tainted Skies:::::At seventeen, Norah has accepted that the four walls of her house delineate her life. She knows that fearing everything from inland tsunamis to odd numbers is irrational, but her mind insists the world outside is too big, too dangerous. So she stays safe inside, watching others lives through her windows and social media feed. But when Luke arrives on her doorstep, he doesn t see a girl defined by medical terms and mental health. Instead, he sees a girl who is funny, smart, and brave. And Norah likes what he sees. Their friendship turns deeper, but Norah knows Luke deserves a normal girl. One who can walk beneath the open sky. One who is unafraid of kissing. One who isn t so screwed up. Can she let him go for his own good or can Norah learn to see herself through Luke s eyes?
