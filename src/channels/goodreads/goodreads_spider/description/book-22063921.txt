22063921:::::Perfectly Damaged:::::Schizoaffective disorder: a mental illness in which a person experiences a combination of mood disorder and schizophrenia symptoms. know about this illness very well because I suffer from it. It s been four years since my diagnosis, and ever since, I ve been living in a dark hole. Voices constantly invading my thoughts. Hallucinations. All of which force me to question if what I m experiencing is even reality. But here I am, still hanging on, still breathing and living through it. That is, until he stumbled into my life. Logan Reed. I don t want any part of him. I ve pushed him away, but he isn t easily deterred. I ve told him I m different, but he doesn t care. He s trying to slowly break me down. I m trying just as hard not to let him. He doesn t know how truly damaged I am; what will happen when he does? I know the truth he ll never be able to look at me the same way again. Just like everybody else.
