28220826:::::When the Moon Was Ours:::::To everyone who knows them, best friends Miel and Sam are as strange as they are inseparable. Roses grow out of Miel s wrist, and rumors say that she spilled out of a water tower when she was five. Sam is known for the moons he paints and hangs in the trees, and for how little anyone knows about his life before he and his mother moved to town. But as odd as everyone considers Miel and Sam, even they stay away from the Bonner girls, four beautiful sisters rumored to be witches. Now they want the roses that grow from Miel s skin, convinced that their scent can make anyone fall in love. And they re willing to use every secret Miel has fought to protect to make sure she gives them up.
