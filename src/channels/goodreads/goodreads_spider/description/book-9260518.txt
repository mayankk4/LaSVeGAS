9260518:::::Never Cry Wolf:::::RUNNING WITH A DANGEROUS CROWD Lucas Simone is not the kind of guy you mess with. He s big, he s strong, and his eyes hint at a wilder side most women can t handle. Of course, that s because his predatory instincts are no metaphor he s a genuine Grade-A top-quality werewolf, tough enough to fight his way to dominance over the scariest pack on the West Coast. There s only one chink in his armor. Unlike most alpha dogs, Lucas has a reputation for protecting the weak and innocent. Sarah King is counting on that protective impulse it s the only thing standing between her and certain death. There are only two problems: one, she s not quite as innocent as she d like Lucas to believe. And two, if he doesn t stop stoking Sarah s animal lust, it s only a matter of time before her own wild side gets unleashed
