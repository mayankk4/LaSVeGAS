15809617:::::The Lost Heir:::::The lost heir to the SeaWing throne is going home at last. She can't believe it's finally happening. Tsunami and her fellow dragonets of destiny are journeying under the water to the great SeaWing Kingdom.

The dragonets came to the SeaWings for protection, but this ocean hides secrets, betrayal--and perhaps even death.
