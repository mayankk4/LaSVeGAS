During World War II and the last days of British occupation in India, fifteen-year-old Vidya dreams of attending college.

Vidya's only refuge becomes her grandfather's upstairs library, which is forbidden to women. There she meets Raman, a young man also living in the house who relishes her intellectual curiosity.
