28954137:::::Tales from the Shadowhunter Academy:::::Simon Lewis has been a human and a vampire, and now he is becoming a Shadowhunter. But the events of City of Heavenly Fire left him stripped of his memories, and Simon isn t sure who he is anymore. He knows he was friends with Clary, and that he convinced the total goddess Isabelle Lightwood to go out with him but he doesn t know how. And when Clary and Isabelle look at him, expecting him to be a man he doesn t remember Simon can t take it. So when the Shadowhunter Academy reopens, Simon throws himself into this new world of demon-hunting, determined to find himself again. His new self. Whomever this new Simon might be. But the Academy is a Shadowhunter institution, which means it has some problems. Like the fact that non-Shadowhunter students have to live in the basement. And that differences like being a former vampire are greatly looked down upon. At least Simon is trained in weaponry even if it s only from hours of playing D&amp;D. Join Simon on his journey to become a Shadowhunter, and learn about the Academy s illustrious history along the way, through guest lecturers such as Jace Herondale, Tessa Gray, and Magnus Bane. These ten short stories give an epilogue to the Mortal Instruments series and provide glimpses of what s in store in the Dark Artifices.
