However, the day William Hayward enters her life, normalcy is the last thing Bryn will be able to count on if she wants to be with him.

Despite every red flag and warning siren going off in her head telling her not to, Bryn falls hard for William, knowing he s categorically different from anyone she s ever met. She never imagined how right she was. When William takes her deeper into the rabbit hole of his world, Bryn must decide just how much she is willing to sacrifice to be with him, knowing no matter what, fate always finds a way to have the last laugh. Spinning a new twist on star-crossed lovers, Eternal Eden will put Bryn through a gauntlet of turmoil, challenging her to find the power within herself to become the heroine in her own story.
