7420106:::::Ambereye:::::Hope Glassy loves her job at Ambereye, Inc., despite having Jolie Garoul as her new boss. Jolie is a moody workaholic. She is awkward, contrary, and on occasion, just plain mean. Hope is hardworking, popular, and in recovery from a serious illness. She doesn't need a bizarre boss. She doesn't need to work over Thanksgiving either. Nevertheless, that's what she and Jolie end up doing...in Little Dip, home of the Garoul clan. An important meeting brings them to the valley where it's assumed Jolie has brought her chosen mate to meet her pack. Much to her consternation, Jolie finds she likes this idea, but Hope has no time for romance. She is eager to get her life on track and her health and career back to normal. Jolie is determined to change her mind, but how does a lycanthrope woo a human? A small, super-efficient, bossy to boots human at that? The second in the Garoul Series.
