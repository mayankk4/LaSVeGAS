But when the money is too good to be true, there s nothing she won t do to please her new boss. She s bought and paid for, so who is she to say no? Especially when she likes it. Warning: This dirty office romance is over-the-top filthy. If you want a possessive alpha with a bossy mouth, then do what you re told and get this book! Seriously, though, if Mason asks, just say you bought it. He s grumpy.
