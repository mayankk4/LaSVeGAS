16141786:::::Everyone Burns:::::It is January 2005 and the charred remains of two Europeans have been discovered on the Thai island of Samui. Local Police Chief Charoenkul, sidelined by his superiors, enlists the reluctant David Braddock, a burnt-out private detective, to assist in an 'unofficial' investigation. But Braddock has problems of his own, including an affair with the same Police Chief's wife ... Peppered with irreverent humour and some pithy comments on everyday life in the Land of Smiles, 'Everyone Burns' is much more than a crime novel. It is also a carefully-crafted psychological study of an anti-hero for our time.
