14487476:::::House:::::A mind-bending supernatural thriller from the creators of "This Present Darkness" and "Saint." Frank Peretti and Ted Dekker-two of the most acclaimed writers of supernatural thrillers-have joined forces for the first time to craft a story unlike any you've ever read. Enter "House"-where you'll find yourself thrown into a killer's deadly game in which the only way to win is to lose . . . and the only way out is in. The stakes of the game become clear when a tin can is tossed into the house with rules scrawled on it. Rules that only a madman-or worse-could have written. Rules that make no sense yet must be followed. "One game. Seven players. Three rules. Game ends at dawn."
