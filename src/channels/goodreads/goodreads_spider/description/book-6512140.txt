6512140:::::Going Bovine:::::Can Cameron find what he s looking for? All 16-year-old Cameron wants is to get through high school and life in general with a minimum of effort. It s not a lot to ask. But that s before he s given some bad news: he s sick and he s going to die. Which totally sucks. Hope arrives in the winged form of Dulcie, a loopy punk angel/possible hallucination with a bad sugar habit. She tells Cam there is a cure if he s willing to go in search of it. With the help of a death-obsessed, video-gaming dwarf and a yard gnome, Cam sets off on the mother of all road trips through a twisted America into the heart of what matters most.
