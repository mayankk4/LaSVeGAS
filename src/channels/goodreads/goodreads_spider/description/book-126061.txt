126061:::::The Double Helix:::::By identifying the structure of DNA, the molecule of life, Francis Crick and James Watson revolutionized biochemistry &amp; won themselves a Nobel Prize. At the time, Watson was only 24, a young scientist hungry to make his mark. His uncompromisingly honest account of the heady days of their thrilling sprint against other world-class researchers to solve one of science's greatest mysteries gives a dazzlingly clear picture of a world of brilliant scientists with great gifts, very human ambitions &amp; bitter rivalries. With humility unspoiled by false modesty, Watson relates his &amp; Crick's desperate efforts to beat Linus Pauling to the Holy Grail of life sciences, the identification of the basic building block of life. Never has a scientist been so truthful in capturing in words the flavor of his work.
