18527475:::::The Titanic Locket:::::Don't touch anything in The Haunted Museum! It looks like the high point of Samantha's spring vacation is going to be a glimpse of a cute boy she sees at The Haunted Museum in England. She and her sister, Jessica, and their parents are taking a cruise on the Titanic 2, a replica of the original Titanic, and there's not even wifi! At least the Titanic exhibit at the Haunted Museum had wax figures and beautiful jewels to look at. But from their first day, Samantha and Jessica notice strange things happening. Their cabin number keeps changing. There are creepy scratching sounds coming from between the walls. And a locket that Jess opened at the museum seems to be . . . following them. Is the locket haunted? Or could it be the ship itself? Are there actors in costume walking about the ship . . .or could they be ghosts? Why is Sam's sister calling her by another name? Samantha will have to unravel the threads tying her and her sister to the past, or they could go down with the ship!
