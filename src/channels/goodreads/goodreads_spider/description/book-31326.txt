31326:::::Theatre:::::In Theatre , W. Somerset Maugham the author of the classic novels Of Human Bondage and Up at the Villa introduces us to Julia Lambert, a woman of breathtaking poise and talent whose looks have stood by her forty-six years. She is one of the greatest actresses England so good, in fact, that perhaps she never stops acting. It seems that noting can ruffle her satin feathers, until a quiet stranger who challenges Julia's very sense of self. As a result, she will endure rejection for the first time, her capacity as a mother will be affronted, and her ability to put on whatever face she desired for her public will prove limited. In Theatre , Maugham subtly exposes the tensions and triumphs that occur when acting and reality blend together, and for Julia ultimately reverse.
