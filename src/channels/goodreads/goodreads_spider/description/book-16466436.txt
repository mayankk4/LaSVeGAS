16466436:::::Unravel:::::Six months ago, I was happy. I was simply Naomi Carradine. One month ago, I was admitted into a psych ward. Yesterday, Lachlan visited me. Kissed me. And told me that I m starting to lose my mind. Hours later, Max haunted my thoughts, reminding me I m not crazy and that he needs my help. A few minutes ago, I drifted further from reality, trying to unravel the past. And now...everyone thinks I m insane. But, I know he's real, and I know he needs me. Do you believe me?
