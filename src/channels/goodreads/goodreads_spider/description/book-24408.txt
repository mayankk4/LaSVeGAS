24408:::::The Bronze Bow:::::He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze. from the Song of David (2 Samuel 22:35) The Bronze Bow , written by Elizabeth George Speare (author of The Witch of Blackbird Pond ) won the Newbery Medal in 1962. This gripping, action-packed novel tells the story of eighteen-year-old Daniel bar Jamin a fierce, hotheaded young man bent on revenging his father s death by forcing the Romans from his land of Israel. Daniel s palpable hatred for Romans wanes only when he starts to hear the gentle lessons of the traveling carpenter, Jesus of Nazareth. A fast-paced, suspenseful, vividly wrought tale of friendship, loyalty, the idea of home, community . . . and ultimately, as Jesus says to Daniel on page 224: Can t you see, Daniel, it is hate that is the enemy? Not men. Hate does not die with killing. It only springs up a hundredfold. The only thing stronger than hate is love. A powerful, relevant read in turbulent times.
