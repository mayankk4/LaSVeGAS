16126319:::::Struck by Lightning: The Carson Philips Journal:::::A hilariously cynical look at high school from Chris Colfer, star of TV's Glee, and based on the feature film of the same name. Struck by Lightning: The Carson Phillips Journal follows the story of outcast high school senior Carson Phillips who blackmails the most popular students into contributing to his literary journal to bolster his college application; his goal in life is to get into Northwestern and eventually become the editor of The New Yorker. At once laugh-out-loud funny, deliciously dark, and remarkably smart, Struck by Lightning unearths the dirt that lies just below the surface of high school.
