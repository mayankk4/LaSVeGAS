4443297:::::The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris & Goodbye to Berlin:::::First published in the 1930s, The Berlin Stories contains two astonishing related novels, The Last of Mr. Norris and Goodbye to Berlin , which are recognized today as classics of modern fiction. Isherwood magnificently captures 1931 Berlin: charming, with its avenues and caf s; marvelously grotesque, with its nightlife and dreamers; dangerous, with its vice and intrigue; powerful and seedy, with its mobs and millionaires this is the period when Hitler was beginning his move to power. The Berlin Stories is inhabited by a wealth of characters: the unforgettable Sally Bowles, whose misadventures in the demimonde were popularized on the American stage and screen by Julie Harris in I Am A Camera and Liza Minnelli in Cabaret ; Mr. Norris, the improbable old debauchee mysteriously caught between the Nazis and the Communists; plump Fr ulein Schroeder, who thinks an operation to reduce the scale of her B ste might relieve her heart palpitations; and the distinguished and doomed Jewish family, the Landauers.
