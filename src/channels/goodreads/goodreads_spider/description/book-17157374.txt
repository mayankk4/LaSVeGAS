17157374:::::Reasons I Fell for the Funny Fat Friend:::::It s stupid to fall for your brother s ex. It s even worse to enlist another s help to win the ex over. But Brody is desperate and Hayley, his partner in American Sign Language, is more than willing to lend him a few tips. She s the school s matchmaker, and with her bizarre and positive personality, Brody finds her easy to talk to, even about the most awkward situations. Hayley s tips seem to be working, but as Brody learns more about his matchmaker, he starts finding reasons to spend time with her, and not the girl he thought he was in love with. But Hayley isn t ready to fall for anyone. Labeled the Funny Fat Friend within her group, her self image makes it impossible for Brody to share his feelings without Hayley shrugging it off as a joke. Convincing her Brody can, and did, fall for the Funny Fat Friend turns out to be harder than simply falling in love. Written by Cassie Mae under the pen name Becca Ann.
