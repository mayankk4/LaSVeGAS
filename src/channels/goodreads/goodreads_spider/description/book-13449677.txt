13449677:::::The Collector:::::He makes good girls...bad. Dante Walker is flippin awesome, and he knows it. His good looks, killer charm, and stellar confidence have made him one of hell s best a soul collector. His job is simple: weed through humanity and label those round rears with a big red good or bad stamp. Old Saint Nick gets the good guys, and he gets the fun ones. Bag-and-tag. Sealing souls is nothing personal. Dante s an equal-opportunity collector and doesn't want it any other way. But he ll have to adjust, because Boss Man has given him a new assignment: Collect Charlie Cooper s soul within ten days. Dante doesn't know why Boss Man wants Charlie, nor does he care. This assignment means only one thing to him, and that s a permanent ticket out of hell. But after Dante meets the quirky Nerd Alert chick he s come to collect, he realizes this assignment will test his abilities as a collector and uncover emotions deeply buried.
