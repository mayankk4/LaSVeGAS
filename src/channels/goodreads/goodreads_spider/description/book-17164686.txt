17164686:::::Wool:::::For suspense-filled, post-apocalyptic thrillers, Wool is more than a self-published eBook phenomenon it s the new standard in classic science fiction. In a ruined and toxic future, a community exists in a giant silo underground, hundreds of stories deep. There, men and women live in a society full of regulations they believe are meant to protect them. Sheriff Holston, who has unwaveringly upheld the silo s rules for years, unexpectedly breaks the greatest taboo of all: He asks to go outside. His fateful decision unleashes a drastic series of events. An unlikely candidate is appointed to replace him: Juliette, a mechanic with no training in law, whose special knack is fixing machines. Now Juliette is about to be entrusted with fixing her silo, and she will soon learn just how badly her world is broken. The silo is about to confront what its history has only hinted about and its inhabitants have never dared to whisper. Uprising. A New York Times and USA TODAY bestseller, as well as Kindle Book Review s 2012 Indie Book of the Year, the self-published eBook blockbuster Wool will now be available in paperback from Simon &amp; Schuster.
