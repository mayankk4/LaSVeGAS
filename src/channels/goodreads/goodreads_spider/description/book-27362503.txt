27362503:::::It Ends with Us:::::Sometimes it is the one who loves you who hurts you the most. Lily hasn t always had it easy, but that s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn t hurt. Lily can t get him out of her head. But Ryle s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his no dating rule, she can t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.
