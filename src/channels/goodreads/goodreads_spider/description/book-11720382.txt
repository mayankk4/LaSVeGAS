11720382:::::Catch Me:::::Charlene Grant believes she is going to die. For the past few years, her childhood friends have been murdered one by one. Same day. Same time. Now she s the last of her friends alive, and she s counting down the final four days of her life until January 21. Charlene doesn t plan on going down without a fight. She has taken up boxing, shooting, and running. She also wants Boston s top homicide detective, D. D. Warren, to handle the investigation. But as D.D. delves deeper into the case, she starts to question the woman s story. Instinct tells her that Charlene may not be in any danger at all. If that s true, the woman must have a secret one so terrifying that it alone could be the greatest threat of all.
