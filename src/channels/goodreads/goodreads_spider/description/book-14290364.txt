14290364:::::Champion:::::He is a Legend. She is a Prodigy. Who will be Champion? June and Day have sacrificed so much for the people of the Republic and each other and now their country is on the brink of a new existence. June is back in the good graces of the Republic, working within the government s elite circles as Princeps-Elect, while Day has been assigned a high-level military position. But neither could have predicted the circumstances that will reunite them: just when a peace treaty is imminent, a plague outbreak causes panic in the Colonies, and war threatens the Republic s border cities. This new strain of plague is deadlier than ever, and June is the only one who knows the key to her country s defense. But saving the lives of thousands will mean asking the one she loves to give up everything. With heart-pounding action and suspense, Marie Lu s bestselling trilogy draws to a stunning conclusion.
