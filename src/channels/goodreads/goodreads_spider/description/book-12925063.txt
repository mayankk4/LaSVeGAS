12925063:::::Inescapable:::::My name is Evie Claremont and this was to be the making of me my freshman year of college. I d been hoping that once I d arrived on Crestwood s campus, the nightmare that I ve been having would go away. It hasn t. I may be an inexperienced seventeen-year-old, but I m grounded sane. I look for rational explanations to even the strangest circumstances. Since meeting sophomore Reed Wellington, however, nothing makes any sense. Whenever he s near, I feel an attraction to him a magnetic kind of force pulling me towards him. I know what you re thinking that sounds fairly awesome. Yeah, it would be if he liked me, but Reed acts as if I m the worst thing that has ever happened to Crestwood or him. But get this, for some reason every time I turn around he s there, barging into my life. What is the secret that he s keeping from me? I m hoping that it s anything but what I suspect: that he s not exactly normal and neither am I. So, maybe Crestwood won t be the making of me, but it could be the breaking of me. I ve been left to wonder if the dark future my dream is foretelling is inescapable.
