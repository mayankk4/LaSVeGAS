20512700:::::Uncovering You: The Contract:::::When I wake up in a dark, unfamiliar room, I have no idea what's waiting for me in the shadows. My imagination conjures up demons of the worst kind. Reality is much worse: A collar with no leash. A prison with no walls. And a life stripped of meaning. I am presented with a vile contract and asked to sign. It outlines the terms of my servitude. The only information I have about my captor are the two small letters inked at the bottom: J.S. Armed with only my memories, I must do everything I can to avoid becoming ensnared in his twisted mind games. But in the end, it all comes down to one choice: Resist and die. Or submit, and sign my life away.
