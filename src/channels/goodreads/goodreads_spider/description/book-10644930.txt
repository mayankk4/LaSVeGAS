10644930:::::11/22/63:::::Life can turn on a dime or stumble into the extraordinary, as it does for Jake Epping, a high school English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine. While grading essays by his GED students, Jake reads a gruesome, enthralling piece penned by janitor Harry Dunning: fifty years ago, Harry somehow survived his father s sledgehammer slaughter of his entire family. Jake is blown away...but an even more bizarre secret comes to light when Jake s friend Al, owner of the local diner, enlists Jake to take over the mission that has become his obsession to prevent the Kennedy assassination. How? By stepping through a portal in the diner s storeroom, and into the era of Ike and Elvis, of big American cars, sock hops, and cigarette smoke... Finding himself in warmhearted Jodie, Texas, Jake begins a new life. But all turns in the road lead to a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald. The course of history is about to be rewritten...and become heart-stoppingly suspenseful.
