110391:::::The Duke and I:::::Can there be any greater challenge to London s Ambitious Mamas than an unmarried duke? Lady Whistledown s Society Papers, April 1813 By all accounts, Simon Basset is on the verge of proposing to his best friend s sister, the lovely and almost-on-the-shelf Daphne Bridgerton . But the two of them know the truth it s all an elaborate plan to keep Simon free from marriage-minded society mothers. And as for Daphne, surely she will attract some worthy suitors now that it seems a duke has declared her desirable. But as Daphne waltzes across ballroom after ballroom with Simon, it s hard to remember that their courtship is a complete sham. Maybe it s his devilish smile, certainly it s the way his eyes seem to burn every time he looks at her but somehow Daphne is falling for the dashing duke for real! And now she must do the impossible and convince the handsome rogue that their clever little scheme deserves a slight alteration, and that nothing makes quite as much sense as falling in love
