20492283:::::Underestimated Too:::::WARNING. This book contains: explicit sex scenes (some forced, some not), intense situations not meant for the faint of heart, abuse, adult language and content. Money is not the most important thing in the world; love is - so they say anyway. Fortunately, Drew loves money. He wasn t capable of loving anything else. The more money he made, the more he needed to make. Always chasing a deal, that was the most important thing in the world to him. You rode Morgan s side of the tracks. Now ride Drew s. You know the things she went through, things nobody should go through. Is Drew sorry for his part in that? Probably not. He s not sure things would have turned out the way they did had he been the cute little husband the critics expected him to be. He did do things that hurt her and regretted a lot of his choices, but he tortured himself, wanting to do them still. You think you know Drew? You don t know squat. You know what his wife has told you. She couldn t tell you more than that, she doesn t know that part of Drew. You want a sappy clich romance? Move on, this isn t the story for you. You want all the gruesome details? Stick around, and then you can judge Drew.
