2728347:::::The Wednesday Sisters:::::When five young mothers Frankie, Linda, Kath, Ally, and Brett first meet in a neighborhood park in the late 1960s, their conversations center on marriage, raising children, and a shared love of books. Then one evening, as they gather to watch the Miss America Pageant, Linda admits that she aspires to write a novel herself, and the Wednesday Sisters Writing Society is born. The five women slowly, and often reluctantly, start filling journals, sliding pages into typewriters, and sharing their work. In the process, they explore the changing world around them: the Vietnam War, the race to the moon, and a women s movement that challenges everything they believe about themselves. At the same time, the friends carry one another through more personal changes ones brought about by infidelity, longing, illness, failure, and success. With one another s support and encouragement, the Wednesday Sisters begin to embrace who they are and what they hope to become, welcoming readers to experience, along with them, the power of dreaming big.
