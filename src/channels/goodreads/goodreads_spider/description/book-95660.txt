95660:::::The Pretty Committee Strikes Back:::::The girls of Octavian Country Day pack up their warmest cashmere coats and their tiniest iPods and board the bus for a President s Day class trip to Lake Placid. But bears aren t the only scary thing out in those woods. The Briarwood Boys are staying in a cabin just a few yards away, which means the girls in Massie s Underground Clinic for Kissing (M.U.C.K) might have to find the guts to put their money where their well-glossed mouths are. Kristen can t afford to go on the trip, but that s not about to stop her. Dylan s mom is smooching her history teacher. Alicia s crush Josh has his eye on someone else. And Claire is about to do whatever it takes to get Cam back.
