6658568:::::Jump:::::Jump. That is what P.K. has done. A totally wild, crazy jump from a restrictive life with her family into a life of total adventure rock-climbing out west with a guy she barely knows. At first, everything s amazing. Not only are they climbing in awesomely beautiful national parks like Yosemite but they seem awesomely made for one another. P.K. is in heaven. And then the cops show up . . . with an arrest warrant. And P.K. has to decide who to believe: this amazing guy whom she trusts with her life or the cops, who want her to believe that he may take her life.
