When Russell discovers Holmes s own secret friendship with the spy, she knows the die is cast: she will accompany her husband to India to search for the missing operative. But Russell soon learns that in this faraway and exotic land, it s often impossible to tell friend from foe and that some games aren t played for fun but for the highest stakes of all life and death.
