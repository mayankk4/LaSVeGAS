In one of history's darkest hours there arose from humble beginnings a man of courage and honor -- the likes of whom the world may never see again. Amid the color, pageantry, and violence of medieval Scotland unfurls the resplendent tale of the legendary William Wallace, farmer by birth, rebel by fate, who banded together his valiant army of Scots to crush the cruel tyranny of the English Plantagenet king. Mel Gibson is William Wallace, the valiant highlander whose epic adventures changed the course of history.
