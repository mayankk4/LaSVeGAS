17660979:::::The Avery Shaw Experiment:::::When Avery Shaw s heart is shattered by her life-long best friend, she chooses to deal with it the only way she knows how scientifically. The state science fair is coming up and Avery decides to use her broken heart as the topic of her experiment. She s going to find the cure. By forcing herself to experience the seven stages of grief through a series of social tests, she believes she will be able to get over Aiden Kennedy and make herself ready to love again. But she can t do this experiment alone, and her partner (ex partner!) is the one who broke her heart. Avery finds the solution to her troubles in the form of Aiden s older brother Grayson. The gorgeous womanizer is about to be kicked off the school basketball team for failing physics. He s in need of a good tutor and some serious extra credit. But when Avery recruits the lovable Grayson to be her objective outside observer, she gets a whole lot more than she bargained for, because Grayson has a theory of his own: Avery doesn t need to grieve. She needs to live. And if there s one thing Grayson Kennedy is good at, it s living life to the fullest.
