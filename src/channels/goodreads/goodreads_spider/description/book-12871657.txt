12871657:::::Body & Soul:::::The final book in The Ghost and the Goth Trilogy! The Ghost I ve been trapped in the body of Lily Ally Turner for a month now. Talk about a fashion crisis on an epic scale. What worries me more, though, is sometimes I catch Will looking at me like he thinks I m Lily...or that he wishes I were. Without the good looks of my former self, I don t know who I am, or if who that is is good enough. I need out of this mess. Now. Will and I have been looking for a solution, one that would separate me from Lily without killing her. But it s not going well. Then, when it seems like things couldn t get any worse, we run into Misty, my former best friend and boyfriend-stealer extraordinaire, who claims she s being haunted...by me. Seriously? I m determined to get to the bottom of who s pretending to be the spirit of Alona Dare (while I m pretending to be someone else) and then get the heck out of this body. Or die trying... The Goth I ll admit it. It s really weird to look at Alona but see Lily. I do know the difference, though, contrary to what Alona might be saying. And Alona is more than a pretty face to me, not that she would believe that. Our one lead for some help in this messed up situation might be a page torn from the yellow pages- the Psychics section- I found in my dad s stuff. One of the fakes seems a bit more real- and odd- than the others. Before I can investigate further, though, Alona is off and chasing a ghost that s probably nothing more than a figment of Misty s guilty imagination. Now Lily s family is freaking out because she didn t come home, my mom is ordering me to stay out of it, and something is definitely wrong with the person formerly known as Lily Ally Turner...
