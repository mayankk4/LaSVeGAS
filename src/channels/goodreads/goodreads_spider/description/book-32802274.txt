When word reaches his fancy corner office that Gallum is replacing himself with his daughter, Amity, Carver is ecstatic. For real this time. Jones squashes men in the business industry flat. A woman? Pfst. He ll be completely in charge in no time, doing whatever he wants. He s so ready for this. But is he ready to fight the hardest fight of his life? No, not the one to maintain control of his company. The one to keep control of his heart. The battle may begin in the boardroom, but the war will definitely be won in the bedroom. May the best sex win.
