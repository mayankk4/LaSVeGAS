229149:::::Cardcaptor Sakura: Master of the Clow, Vol. 1:::::Capturing Cards was only the beginning... Once upon a magic night, an English sorcerer mixed Western wizardry with Eastern enchantments to create a magical deck of cards called the Clow Cards. These cards were hidden inside a dusty old book for decades, their powers virtually wasted. Then one fateful day, a young girl named Sakura Kinomoto discovered the book in her father's library. When she opened it, however, the Clow Cards were gone and so was life as she knew it. The book's magical guardian, a diminutive winged lion, named Sakura the Cardcaptor, and after many exciting adventures, she finally retrieved all of the cards. Now Sakura has earned the title Master of the Clow. An ominous force is brewing in Tomoeda. New enchantments are popping up all over the city, and Sakura's Clow Cards seem completely unable to stop them. But when Sakura taps into her inner power to fuel the Clow Cards, she unlocks a new magic of her own creation. Thus begins this 10-year-old's quest to become the greatest magician in the world!
