The hunt leads to Paris, where a deadly trap is sprung as the bullet leaves Rapp s silenced pistol followed by the discovery of nine bodies, including Libya s oil minister, in one of the city s finest hotels. Washington wants no part of the international crisis, and Rapp is deemed a liability by Stan Hurley, one of his handlers.
