25422262:::::Pucked:::::With a famous NHL player for a step-brother, Violet Hall is well acquainted with the playboy reputation many hockey stars come with. She s smart enough to steer clear of those hot, well-built boys with unparalleled stamina. That is until she meets the legendary team captain Alex Waters. Violet isn t interested in his pretty, beat-up face, or his rock-hard six-pack abs. But when Alex inadvertently obliterates Violet s previous misapprehension regarding the inferior intellect of hockey players, he becomes more than just a hot body with a face to match. In what can only be considered a complete lapse in judgment, Violet finds out just how good Alex is with the hockey stick in his pants. But what starts out as a one-night stand, quickly turns into something more. Post-night of orgasmic magic, Alex starts to call, and text, and e-mail and send extravagant and quirky gifts, making him difficult to ignore, and even more difficult not to like. The problem is, the media portrays Alex as a total player, and Violet doesn t want to be part of the game.
