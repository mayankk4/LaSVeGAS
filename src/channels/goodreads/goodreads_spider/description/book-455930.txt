455930:::::Echo Burning:::::Hitching rides is an unreliable mode of transport. In temperatures of over a hundred degrees, you re lucky if a driver will open the door of his air-conditioned car long enough to let you slide in. That s Jack Reacher s conclusion. He s adrift in the fearsome heat of a Texas summer, and he needs to keep moving through the wide open vastness, like a shark in the water. The last thing he s worried about is exactly who picks him up. He never expected it to be somebody like Carmen. She s alone, driving a Cadillac. She s beautiful, young and rich. She has a little girl who is being watched by unseen observers. And a husband who is in jail. Who will beat her senseless when he comes out. If he doesn t kill her first. Reacher is no stranger to trouble. And at Carmen s remote ranch in Echo County there is plenty of it: lies and prejudice, hatred and murder. Reacher can never resist a lady in distress. Her family is hostile. The cops can t be trusted. The lawyers won t help. If Reacher can t set things straight, who can?
