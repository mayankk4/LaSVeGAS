17666976:::::Sparrow Hill Road:::::Rose Marshall died in 1952 in Buckley Township, Michigan, run off the road by a man named Bobby Cross a man who had sold his soul to live forever, and intended to use her death to pay the price of his immortality. Trouble was, he didn t ask Rose what she thought of the idea. It s been more than sixty years since that night, and she s still sixteen, and she s still running. They have names for her all over the country: the Girl in the Diner. The Phantom Prom Date. The Girl in the Green Silk Gown. Mostly she just goes by Rose, a hitchhiking ghost girl with her thumb out and her eyes fixed on the horizon, trying to outrace a man who never sleeps, never stops, and never gives up on the idea of claiming what s his. She s the angel of the overpass, she s the darling of the truck stops, and she s going to figure out a way to win her freedom. After all, it s not like it can kill her. You can t kill what s already dead.
