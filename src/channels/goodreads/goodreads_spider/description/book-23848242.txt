23848242:::::Nexis:::::In the domed city of Evanescence, appearance is everything. A Natural Born amongst genetically-altered Aristocrats, all Ella ever wanted was to be like everyone else. Augmented, sparkling, and perfect. Then the crash. Devastated by her father s death and struggling with her new physical limitations, Ella is terrified to learn she is not just alone, but little more than a prisoner. Her only escape is to lose herself in Nexis, the hugely popular virtual reality game her father created. In Nexis she meets Guster, a senior player who guides Ella through the strange and compelling new world she now inhabits. He offers Ella guidance, friendship and something more. Something that allows her to forget about the real world, and makes her feel whole again. But Nexis isn t quite the game everyone thinks it is. And it s been waiting for Ella.
