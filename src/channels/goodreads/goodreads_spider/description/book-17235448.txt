17235448:::::The Wrong Side of Right:::::Kate Quinn s mom died last year, leaving Kate parentless and reeling. So when the unexpected shows up in her living room, Kate must confront another reality she never thought possible or thought of at all. Kate does have a father. He s a powerful politician. And he s running for U.S. President. Suddenly, Kate s moving in with a family she never knew she had, joining a campaign in support of a man she hardly knows, and falling for a rebellious boy who may not have the purest motives.

Does she turn to the family she barely knows, the boy she knows but doesn t necessarily trust, or face a third, even scarier option?
