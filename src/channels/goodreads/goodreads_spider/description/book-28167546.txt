What It Is: In this special one-shot issue, a monster is terrorizing the Lumberjanes camp and the girls go to stop it. However, it turns out that the monster is being framed and now the girls have to figure out who s doing it and to what end! Join April, Jo, Mal, Molly and Ripley as they earn their Beyond Bay Leaf pin!
