15990969:::::Ten Tiny Breaths:::::Kacey Cleary s whole life imploded four years ago in a drunk-driving accident. Now she s working hard to bury the pieces left behind all but one. Her little sister, Livie. Kacey can swallow the constant disapproval from her born-again aunt Darla over her self-destructive lifestyle; she can stop herself from going kick-boxer crazy on Uncle Raymond when he loses the girls college funds at a blackjack table. She just needs to keep it together until Livie is no longer a minor, and then they can get the hell out of Grand Rapids, Michigan. But when Uncle Raymond slides into bed next to Livie one night, Kacey decides it s time to run. Armed with two bus tickets and dreams of living near the coast, Kacey and Livie start their new lives in a Miami apartment complex, complete with a grumpy landlord, a pervert upstairs, and a neighbor with a stage name perfectly matched to her chosen profession. But Kacey s not worried. She can handle all of them. What she can t handle is Trent Emerson in apartment 1D. Kacey doesn t want to feel. She doesn t. It s safer that way. For everyone. But sexy Trent finds a way into her numb heart, reigniting her ability to love again. She starts to believe that maybe she can leave the past where it belongs and start over. Maybe she s not beyond repair. But Kacey isn t the only one who s broken. Seemingly perfect Trent has an unforgiveable past of his own; one that, when discovered, will shatter Kacey s newly constructed life and send her back into suffocating darkness.
