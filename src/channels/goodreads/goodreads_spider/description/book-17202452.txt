17202452:::::One Week Girlfriend:::::Temporary. That one single word best describes my life these last few years. I m working at a temporary job until I can finally break free. I m my little brother s temporary mother since our mom doesn t give a crap about either of us. And I m that temporary girl all the guys want to get with because I give it up so easily. According to the rumors, at least. But now I m the temporary girlfriend of Drew Callahan, college football legend and all around golden guy. He s beautiful, sweet and he s hiding way more secrets than I am. He s brought me into this fake life where everyone seems to hate me. And everyone seems to want something from him. The only thing he seems to want though is Me. I don t know what to believe anymore. All I know is, I think Drew needs me. And I want to be there for him. Forever.
