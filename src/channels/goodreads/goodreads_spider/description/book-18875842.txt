18875842:::::Neanderthal Marries Human:::::There are three things you should know about Quinn Sullivan: 1) He is madly in love with Janie Morris, 2) He s not above playing dirty to get what (or who) he wants, and 3) He doesn t know how to knit. After just five months of dating Janie, Quinn former Wendell and unapologetic autocrat is ready to propose marriage. In fact, he s more than ready. If it were up to Quinn, he would efficiently propose, marry, and beget Janie with child all in the same day thereby avoiding the drama and angst that accompanies the four stages of pre-matrimony: engagement, meeting the parents, bachelor/bachelorette party, and overblown, superfluous wedding day traditions. But Janie, much to Quinn s dismay, tosses a wrench in his efficacious endeavors and challenges him to prove his devotion by going through the matrimonial motions, no matter how minute and mundane. Will Quinn last until the wedding day? Or will he yield to his tyrant impulses? Regardless, one thing is for certain, Quinn Sullivan will have to learn to expect the Spanish Inquisition (i.e. the unexpected) if he plans to have and keep Janie Morris as his wife. This book is not a standalone. It is the sequel to Neanderthal Seeks Human, it is book #1.5 in the Knitting in the City series, and it is a full length, 100k word novel. Again, you must read Neanderthal Seeks Human first before reading this book. This book is written in first person, alternating POV (Janie Morris AND Quinn Sullivan; but more Janie than Quinn).
