18144009:::::The Intern's Handbook:::::Interns are invisible. That s the mantra behind HR, Inc., an elite "placement agency" that doubles as a network of assassins-for-hire, taking down high-profile executives who wouldn't be able to remember an intern s name if their lives depended on it. At the ripe old age of twenty-five, John Lago is already New York City s most successful hit man. He s also an intern at a prestigious Manhattan law firm, clocking eighty hours a week getting coffee, answering phones, and doing all the grunt work no one else wants to do. But he isn't trying to claw his way to the top of the corporate food chain. He was hired to assassinate one of the firm s heavily guarded partners. His internship is the perfect cover, enabling him to gather intel and gain access in order to pull off a clean, untraceable hit. The Intern s Handbook is John Lago's unofficial survival guide for new recruits at HR, Inc. (Rule #4: "Learn how to make the perfect cup of coffee: you make an exec the best coffee he s ever had, and he will make sure you re at his desk every morning for a repeat performance. That s repetitive exposure, which begets access and trust. 44% of my kills came from my superior coffee-making abilities.") Part confessional, part how-to, the handbook chronicles John s final assignment, a twisted thrill ride in which he is pitted against the toughest and sexiest adversary he s ever faced: Alice, an FBI agent assigned to take down the same law partner he s been assigned to kill.
