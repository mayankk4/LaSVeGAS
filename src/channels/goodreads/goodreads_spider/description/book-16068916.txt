In the other, she remains home, in her ordinary suburb, where she expects her ordinary life to continue but nothing is as it seems. In both summers, she will fall in love and discover new sides of herself. What may break her, though, is a terrible family secret, one she can't hide from anywhere. In the end, it may just be the truth she needs the most.
