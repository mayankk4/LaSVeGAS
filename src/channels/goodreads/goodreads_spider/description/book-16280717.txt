16280717:::::The Devil's Son:::::Chief of Police, Brady Simone is determined to go after the man that killed his parents but his new brother-in-law, Nicholas Jayzon, is doing everything he can to point him away from the man known as The Barron . The Barron, or rather, Dennis Savage, has inflicted his own kind of evil on people for longer than anyone can remember. Savage has no fear because no one can touch him, no one can get near him except Nick. With darkened tenacity, Savage has watched Nick since he was a child and has never given up on his pursuit of him. He will do anything to have Nick join him and become a part of his organization. Savage will even allow Brady Simone to pursue him for a time, without killing him. For the sake of his sister s happiness protecting Brady is important but keeping Savage away from his sister is Nick s primary goal. If Savage learns of Lena, she will instantly be marked for death. Nick has no choice but to meet Savage in his own territory and ask for a favor, something he has avoided at all costs until now. Their meeting is ominous. It brings back memories and rekindles Savage s desire to have Nick take the place where his father once stood. Will Nick be allowed to decline Savage s offer again? Or will Nick find killers on his heels, ready to take his place in Savage s favor? Or will Savage simply kill everyone that gets in his way and replace his desire for Nick with the only one that can replace him - Nicky? Savage s voice cuts through my pain and releases me, allowing me to finally see again. To see Nicky hiding under the table, crying for his mother while Eey stands guard in front of my son with a ferociousness that even I wouldn t dare go near. But it is Kayla that begins to weaken by his hands, slowly closing her eyes and beginning to near death while I can do nothing but watch. I have no choice now Nicholas Jayzon
