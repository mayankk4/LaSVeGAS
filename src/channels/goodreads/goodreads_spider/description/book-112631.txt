112631:::::Startled by His Furry Shorts:::::On the rack of romance. And also in the oven of "luuurve," And possibly on my way to the "bakery of pain," And maybe even going to stop along the way to get a little "cake" at the cakeshop of agony. "Shut up," brain, shut up. Georgia is in quite a predicament. Dave the Laugh has declared his love for her (at least she thinks he was talking about her), leaving her in a state of confusiosity. And then when she finally decides to give Masimo an ultimatum -- to be her one and only -- he tells her he needs to think about it. To distract herself from her romantic woes, Georgia throws herself into Mac-Useless play rehearsals and planning a Viking wedding, and tries to avoid all thoughts of boy decoys, Italian-American dreamboats . . . and let's not forget guitar-plucking Sex Gods!
