43691:::::The Master:::::Colm T ib n s beautiful, subtle illumination of Henry James s inner life ( The New York Times ) captures the loneliness and hope of a master of psychological subtlety whose forays into intimacy inevitably fail those he tried to love. Beautiful and profoundly moving, The Master tells the story of Henry James, a man born into one of America s first intellectual families who leaves his country in the late nineteenth century to live in Paris, Rome, Venice, and London among privileged artists and writers. With stunningly resonant prose, The Master is unquestionably the work of a first-rate novelist: artful, moving, and very beautiful ( The New York Times Book Review ). The emotional intensity of this portrait is riveting.
