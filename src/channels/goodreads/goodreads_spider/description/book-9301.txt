9301:::::Rachel's Holiday:::::Meet Rachel Walsh. She has a pair of size 8 feet and such a fondness for recreational drugs that her family has forked out the cash for a spell in Cloisters Dublin s answer to the Betty Ford Clinic. She s only agreed to her incarceration because she s heard that rehab is wall-to-wall jacuzzis, gymnasiums and rock stars going tepid turkey and it s about time she had a holiday. But what Rachel doesn t count on are the toe-curling embarrassments heaped on her by family and group therapy, the dearth of sex, drugs and rock n roll and missing Luke, her ex. What kind of a new start in life is this?
