32707506:::::Written in the Scars:::::Falling in love is easy. Falling out of love is the hardest thing in the world. And Elin and Ty Whitt are terrible at it. The first time the local basketball star smiled at Elin, she was a goner. It was just so damn easy to fall for the dark-haired hometown hero with his charming smile and strong, athletic build. Thousands of sleepy smiles, aimless drives down country roads, and squeaks of the backdoor after a swing shift later, reality hits. And it hits hard. Falling in love was definitely the easy part. Watching it break apart was impossible. Through the tears, the second-guesses, the memories of a life built together, the world keeps spinning. With each turn comes clarity and hope sometimes in the form of a pair of muddy boots by the back door or from the words of a wise friend. When Ty shows back up with a new found determination to put his family back together, Elin's torn between the fights of the past and the possibility of a new start. This is the man that holds her heart, the man she loves beyond anything else. But this is also the one person in the world that can cause her the most pain. Life s not always easy. Love s not for the faint of heart. But with life comes lessons and Ty and Elin have the scars to prove it. But it's their love written in those scars that will hold them together or break them apart. A brand new STANDALONE ROMANCE from USA Today Bestselling author Adriana Locke.
