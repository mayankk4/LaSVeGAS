Recently divorced, jobless, friendless and utterly alone, Poppy Montgomery is struggling to convince herself that single life is what she wants needs. Then a handsome stranger staggers into her life and sparks fly. Riding out the storm together, their instant connection seems like the perfect opportunity to explore a night of passion, but will one night be enough to satisfy their craving for one another? AUTHOR'S NOTE: Stranded is the first in an interconnected series of erotic romance. Each book can be read as a stand alone, but you will find that each new character has been previously introduced in some way. As an introduction to the series, Stranded is a novella, but rest assured each new addition will be a full length novel worth sinking your teeth into.
