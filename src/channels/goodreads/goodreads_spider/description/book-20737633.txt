Everyone knew that Wyverns were bad news, and just as evil as the darkness that lurked inside Blake Leaf, the Rubicon forced to fight against his inner nature every day. But Elena can see a small light lurking in the darkness, a destiny still unfulfilled; to prove that Wyverns can be claimed. Will Lucian s dark secret about Wyverns and Elena s need to prove their true nature cause their love to be torn apart? And which of Elena s friends will be sacrificed this time if she is wrong?
