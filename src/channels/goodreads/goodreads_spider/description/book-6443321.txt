6443321:::::These Boots Are Made for Stalking:::::Massie Block: Now that Massie's in luh-v with a freshman at ADD, it's time for the Pretty Committe to upgrade--literally. Armed with glossy hair, juicy gossip, and enough confidence to impress the ninth grade set, Massie can walk the walk. But when she catches Landon hanging out with a bird-tattooed mystery girl, will she have to stalk the hawk? Alicia Rivera: Thought she and Josh Hotz were a perfect fit... until she found out they wear the same clothing size. Ehma-unacceptable! Maybe she should try on a new crush in size nine--ninth grade, that is. Kristen Gregory: Is booooored of Dempsey's constant soccer talk. When a high school hawtie makes a play for her attention, she may need to drop-kick her old crush to the curb... Dylan Marvil: Loves lip-kissing Derrington. But when he loses a bet and has to wear his clothes backwards, all bets on another smooch session are off. Claire Lyons: Is clinging to eighth grade like ugly on a Kmart jumper. Why grow up before you have to? But if she refuses to trade Cam in for a ninth-grade crush, will her friends outgrow her?
