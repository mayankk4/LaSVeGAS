2879805:::::I Know It's Over:::::PURE. UNPLANNED. PERFECT. Those were Nick s summer plans before Sasha stepped into the picture. With the collateral damage from his parents divorce still settling and Dani (his girl of the moment) up for nearly anything, complications are the last thing he needs. All that changes, though, when Nick runs into Sasha at the beach in July. Suddenly he s neck-deep in a relationship and surprised to find he doesn t mind in the least. But Nick s world shifts again when Sasha breaks up with him. Then, weeks later, while Nick s still reeling from the breakup, she turns up at his doorstep and tells him she s pregnant. Nick finds himself struggling once more to understand the girl he can t stop caring for, the girl who insists that it s still over.
