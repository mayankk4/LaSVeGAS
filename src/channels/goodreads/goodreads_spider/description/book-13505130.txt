13505130:::::The Absent One:::::In The Keeper of Lost Causes, Jussi Adler-Olsen introduced Detective Carl M rck, a deeply flawed, brilliant detective newly assigned to run Department Q, the home of Copenhagen s coldest cases. The result wasn t what M rck or readers expected, but by the opening of Adler-Olsen s shocking, fast-paced follow-up, M rck is satisfied with the notion of picking up long-cold leads. So he s naturally intrigued when a closed case lands on his desk: A brother and sister were brutally murdered two decades earlier, and one of the suspects part of a group of privileged boarding-school students confessed and was convicted. But once M rck reopens the files, it becomes clear that all is not what it seems. Looking into the supposedly solved case leads him to Kimmie, a woman living on the streets, stealing to survive. Kimmie has mastered evading the police, but now they aren t the only ones looking for her. Because Kimmie has secrets that certain influential individuals would kill to keep buried . . . as well as one of her own that could turn everything on its head.
