25772000:::::Cocky Bastard:::::He was someone who belonged in my wildest fantasies instead of a rest stop in the middle of Nebraska. A sexy, cocky, Australian named Chance was the last person I expected to run into on my cross-country drive. When my car broke down, we made a deal. Next thing I knew, we were traveling together, spending sexually-tense nights in hotels and taking unplanned detours. My ordinary road trip turned into the adventure of a lifetime. It was all fun and games until things got intense. I wanted him, but Chance wouldn t make a move. I thought he wanted me too, but something was holding him back. I wasn t supposed to fall for the cocky bastard, especially when I knew we d be going our separate ways. All good things must come to an end, right? Except our ending was one I didn t see coming.
