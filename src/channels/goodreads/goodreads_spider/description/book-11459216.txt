11459216:::::Widows Web:::::I used to murder people for money, but these days it s more of a survival technique. Once an assassin, always an assassin. So much for being plain old Gin Blanco. With every lowlife in Ashland gunning for me, I don t need another problem, but a new one has come to town. Salina might seem like a sweet Southern belle, but she s really a dangerous enemy whose water elemental magic can go head-to-head with my own Ice and Stone power. Salina also has an intimate history with my lover, Owen Grayson, and now that she s back in town, she thinks he s hers for the taking. Salina s playing a mysterious game that involves a shady local casino owner with a surprising connection to Owen. But they call me the Spider for a reason. I m going to untangle her deadly scheme, even if it leaves my love affair hanging by a thread.
