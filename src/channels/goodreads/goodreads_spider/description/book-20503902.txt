20503902:::::In The Blood:::::A Best Book of the Year -- Goodreads Choice Awards Nominee, Silver Falchion Award Winner, Suspense Magazine Best Books, Sun-Sentinel Best Mystery Novels, CBC Morning Show Top Pick, Indie Next Pick and Amazon Best Book of the Month. Liar, liar, pants on fire . . . College senior Lana Granger has told so many lies about her past that the truth seems like a distant, cloudy nightmare. But she meets her match when she begins babysitting for a volatile, manipulative eleven-year-old boy. Soon after Lana takes the job, her close friend Beck mysteriously disappears. Lana instantly begins fabricating stories-to friends, to police, to herself. Why doesn't her account jibe with those of eye-witnesses? Lana will do anything to bury the truth about that night...and about her life. But someone else knows her secrets. And he's dying to tell. As darkly startling and finely crafted as her blockbuster bestsellers Beautiful Lies and Fragile , Lisa Unger's masterful new psychological thriller has already "set the bar for thrillers to come" ( BookReporter ) and is "guaranteed to keep the pages turning long past the midnight hour."
