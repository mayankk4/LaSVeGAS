176271:::::Halloween Party:::::Welcome to Fear Street. Don t listen to the stories they tell you about Fear Street. Wouldn t you rather explore it yourself and see if its dark terror and unexplained mysteries are true? You re not afraid, are you? Invitation to Terror The invitation arrived in a black-bordered envelope. Inside, the card showed a coffin with the inscription Reserved For You. It was perfectly fitting for an all-night Halloween party on Fear Street. But Terry and his girlfriend Niki wondered why they had been invited. They barely knew Justine Cameron, the beautiful and mysterious transfer student who was throwing the party. The party was well under way when the lights went out. That s to be expected at a spooky Halloween party. But when the lights come back on, there was that boy on the floor with the knife in his back. Just a Halloween prank? Maybe. Maybe not. For Terry and Niki the trick-or-treating has turned to terror. To their horror, they realize that someone at the costume party is dressed to kill!
