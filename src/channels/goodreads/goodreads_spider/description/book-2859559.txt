2859559:::::Devil's Brood:::::The long-awaited and highly anticipated final volume in Penman s trilogy of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine a tumultuous conclusion to this timeless story of love, power, ambition, and betrayal . Where the second novel in the trilogy, Time And Chance , dealt with the extraordinary politics of the twelfth century, climaxing with the murder of Thomas Becket and Henry s confrontation with the Church and self-imposed exile to Ireland, Devil s Brood centers on the implosion of a family. And because it is a royal family whose domains span the English Channel and whose alliances encompass the Christian world, that collapse will have dire consequences. This is a story of betrayal as Henry s three eldest sons and his wife enter into a rebellion against him, aligning themselves with his bitterest enemy, King Louis of France. But it is also the story of a great king whose brilliance forged an empire but whose personal blind spots led him into the most serious mistake of his life. Sharon Kay Penman has created a novel of tremendous power, as two strong-willed, passionate people clash, a family divides, and a marriage ends in all but name. Curiously, it is a novel without villains only flawed human beings caught up in misperceptions and bad judgment calls. Most devastating to Henry was not his sons rebellion but his wife s betrayal in joining them. How could it happen that two people whose love for each other was all consuming end up as bitter adversaries? That is the heart of Penman s tale in Devil s Brood .
