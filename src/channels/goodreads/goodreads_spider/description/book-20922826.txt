20922826:::::What We Saw:::::Kate Weston can piece together most of the bash at John Doone s house: shots with Stacey Stallard, Ben Cody taking her keys and getting her home early the feeling that maybe he s becoming more than just the guy she s known since they were kids. But when a picture of Stacey passed out over Deacon Mills s shoulder appears online the next morning, Kate suspects she doesn t have all the details. When Stacey levels charges against four of Kate s classmates, the whole town erupts into controversy. Facts that can t be ignored begin to surface, and every answer Kate finds leads back to the same question: Where was Ben when a terrible crime was committed? This story inspired by real events from debut novelist Aaron Hartzler takes an unflinching look at silence as a form of complicity. It s a book about the high stakes of speaking up, and the razor thin line between guilt and innocence that so often gets blurred, one hundred and forty characters at a time.
