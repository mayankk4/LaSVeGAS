Though they enjoy a life where sex and art are just beginning to break through the fa ade of conventional society, the city is also exhibiting a disturbing increase in anti-Semitism, as political hatred foments in the shadows of Adele s coffee house afternoons and cultural salons. Nearly forty years later, Adele s niece Maria Altmann is a newlywed when the Nazis invade Austria and overnight, her beloved Vienna becomes a war zone. When her husband is arrested and her family is forced out of their home, Maria must summon the courage and resilience that is her aunt s legacy if she is to survive and keep her family and their history alive. Will Maria and her family escape the Nazis grip? And what will become of the paintings that her aunt nearly sacrificed everything for?

It juxtaposes passion and discovery against hatred and despair, and shines a light on our ability to love, to destroy, and above all, to endure.
