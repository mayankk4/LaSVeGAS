20645941:::::The Story of Us:::::I love him, from the instant I set eyes on him when I was just 11 years old I have loved him and nothing will ever change that, he owns me, he owns my heart and he owns my body and no matter how many lies are told, no matter how many people conspire to keep us apart, despite the fame and the distance, we will find a way. "Georgia Rae, when we made love you used to cry" ... He waits for me to sing my bit. I try to swallow down a sob but I just end up singing through it... "I said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die" Carnage is an edgy coming of age love story that breaks all the rules and transcends the decades. Georgia and Sean's story will stay with you long after you read the final word. An emotional, smoking hot, gut wrenching read. NOTE: This is part #1 of a 2 part story but can be read as a stand alone.
