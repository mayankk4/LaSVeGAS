6202183:::::The Sugar Queen:::::In this irresistible novel, Sarah Addison Allen, author of the New York Times bestselling debut, Garden Spells , tells the tale of a young woman whose family secrets and secret passions are about to change her life forever. Josey Cirrini is sure of three things: winter is her favorite season, she s a sorry excuse for a Southern belle, and sweets are best eaten in the privacy of her closet. For while Josey has settled into an uneventful life in her mother s house, her one consolation is the stockpile of sugary treats and paperback romances she escapes to each night . Until she finds her closet harboring Della Lee Baker, a local waitress who is one part nemesis and two parts fairy godmother. With Della Lee s tough love, Josey s narrow existence quickly expands. She even bonds with Chloe Finley, a young woman who is hounded by books that inexplicably appear when she needs them and who has a close connection to Josey s longtime crush. Soon Josey is living in a world where the color red has startling powers, and passion can make eggs fry in their cartons. And that s just for starters. Brimming with warmth, wit, and a sprinkling of magic, here is a spellbinding tale of friendship, love and the enchanting possibilities of every new day.
