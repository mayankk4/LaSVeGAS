His first novel, Almost Transparent Blue , won Japan s most coveted literary prize and sold over a million copies, and his most recent psychosexual thriller, In the Miso Soup , gave readers a further taste of his incredibly agile imagination. In Piercing , Murakami, in his own unique style, explores themes of child abuse and what happens to the voiceless among us, weaving a disturbing, spare tale of two people who find each other and then are forced into hurting each other deeply because of the haunting specter of their own abuse as children.
