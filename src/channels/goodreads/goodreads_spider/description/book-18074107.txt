18074107:::::Out of Line:::::Desperate to break free I've spent my entire life under my father s thumb, but now I'm finally free to make my own choices. When my roommate dragged me to my first college party, I met Finn Coram and my life turned inside out. He knows how to break the rules and is everything I never knew I wanted. A Marine by day and surfer by night, he pushes me away even as our attraction brings us closer. Now I am finally free to do whatever I want. I know what I want. I choose Finn. Trying to play by the rules... I always follow orders. My job, my life, depends on it. I thought this job would be easy, all the rules were made crystal clear, but when I met Carrie Wallington, everything got muddy. She's a rule I know I shouldn't break, but damn if I don t inch closer to the breaking point each time I see her. I m ready to step out of line. And even worse? I m living a lie. They say the truth will set you free, but in my case The truth will cost me everything.
