17262197:::::The Wolves of Midwinter:::::The tale of THE WOLF GIFT continues . . . In Anne Rice s surprising and compelling best-selling novel, the first of her strange and mythic imagining of the world of wolfen powers ( I devoured these pages . . . As solid and engaging as anything she has written since her early vampire chronicle fiction Alan Cheuse, The Boston Globe; A delectable cocktail of old-fashioned lost-race adventure, shape-shifting and suspense Elizabeth Hand, The Washington Post), readers were spellbound as Rice imagined a daring new world set against the wild and beckoning California coast. Now in her new novel, as lush and romantic in detail and atmosphere as it is sleek and steely in storytelling, Anne Rice brings us once again to the rugged coastline of Northern California, to the grand mansion at Nideck Point to further explore the unearthly education of her transformed Man Wolf. The novel opens on a cold, gray landscape. It is the beginning of December. Oak fires are burning in the stately flickering hearths of Nideck Point. It is Yuletide. For Reuben Golding, now infused with the wolf gift and under the loving tutelage of the Morphenkinder, this Christmas promises to be like no other . . . as he soon becomes aware that the Morphenkinder, steeped in their own rituals, are also celebrating the Midwinter Yuletide festival deep within Nideck forest. From out of the shadows of the exquisite mansion comes a ghost tormented, imploring, unable to speak yet able to embrace and desire with desperate affection . . . As Reuben finds himself caught up with the passions and yearnings of this spectral presence and the preparations for the Nideck town Christmas reach a fever pitch, astonishing secrets are revealed, secrets that tell of a strange netherworld, of spirits centuries old who possess their own fantastical ancient histories and taunt with their dark, magical powers . . .
