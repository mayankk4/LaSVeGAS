26067507:::::Places No One Knows:::::For fans of Lauren Oliver and E. Lockhart, here is a dreamy love story set in the dark halls of contemporary high school, from New York Times bestselling author Brenna Yovanoff. Waverly Camdenmar spends her nights running until she can t even think. Then the sun comes up, life goes on, and Waverly goes back to her perfectly hateful best friend, her perfectly dull classes, and the tiny, nagging suspicion that there s more to life than student council and GPAs. Marshall Holt is a loser. He drinks on school nights and gets stoned in the park. He is at risk of not graduating, he does not care, he is no one. He is not even close to being in Waverly s world. But then one night Waverly falls asleep and dreams herself into Marshall s bedroom and when the sun comes up, nothing in her life can ever be the same. In Waverly s dreams, the rules have changed. But in her days, she ll have to decide if it s worth losing everything for a boy who barely exists.
