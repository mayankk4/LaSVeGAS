As battle cries of the American Revolution echo in the distance, servants flutter about preparing for one of New York society s biggest events: the Schuylers grand ball. Descended from two of the oldest and most distinguished bloodlines in New York, the Schuylers are proud to be one of their fledgling country s founding families, and even prouder still of their three daughters Angelica, with her razor-sharp wit; Peggy, with her dazzling looks; and Eliza, whose beauty and charm rival that of both her sisters, though she d rather be aiding the colonists cause than dressing up for some silly ball. Still, she can barely contain her excitement when she hears of the arrival of one Alexander Hamilton, a mysterious, rakish young colonel and General George Washington s right-hand man. Though Alex has arrived as the bearer of bad news for the Schuylers, he can t believe his luck as an orphan, and a bastard one at that to be in such esteemed company. And when Alex and Eliza meet that fateful night, so begins an epic love story that would forever change the course of American history.
