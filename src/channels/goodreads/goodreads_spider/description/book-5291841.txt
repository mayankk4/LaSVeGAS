5291841:::::Boys "R" Us:::::Massie Block: After disbanding the Pretty Committee, Massie takes charge like Visa, forming OCD's hawtest clique yet: Massie And Crew. Even though money can't buy love, it can buy new friends . . . or at least model-actresses who will act like your besties until you get real ones. Lights, camera, MACtion! Alicia Rivera: Hearts her new role as alpha of the Soul-M8s, BOCD's first ever boy-girl clique. But when the boys head back to the newly renovated Briarwood Academy, will the remaining Soul-M8s become 4Squares? Dylan Marvil: Is happy times ten to finally have a crush who's crushing back, especially since they luh-v all the same things: marshmallows, lip-kissing, and chugging Red Bull. Buuuuuuuuurrrrrrrp! Kristen Gregory: Scored three goals on the soccer field last week-and Massie's crush . . . which earned her an ejection from her ex -BFF's heart. Can Massie forgive and forget, or is Kristen out of the game forever? Claire Lyons: Has declared herself neutral in the battle of the cliques. But dividing her time among Massie, the Soul-M8s, and Cam has left her stretched thinner than extra-small Spanx. Can she get her friends to reunite, or will she be forced to pick a side once and for all? The Clique . . . the only thing harder than getting in is staying in.
