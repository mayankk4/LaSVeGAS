17671114:::::Locked:::::Who is Sebastian Lock? The bar Sophia Pearce is in doesn t look like much. The wine is bad and the decor worse. But when a sudden attack of curiosity leads her to sneak past security and into the back room, she discovers something unimaginable. The most lavish party she s ever laid eyes on, in the most unlikely of places. But that s nothing compared to what comes next, to the man she meets back there. Sebastian Lock. Gorgeous, commanding, and radiating charm, he is exactly the sort of silver-tongued rake Sophia has sworn to avoid. Unfortunately, he doesn t care much for her promises. Every instinct tells her to run, but the chemistry between them is as inescapable as gravity. Soon, he s opening her eyes to a whole new world of pleasures, pleasures she never thought she d enjoy. There s just one problem. Sebastian is more than he seems. Between the famous company he keeps and the almost paranoid secrecy of his employers, he s a puzzle Sophia can t quite solve, and his insistence on keeping things casual forces her to confront the demons of her past. Can she learn to trust again? Or will Sebastian s privacy tear them apart? Contains light BDSM, including spanking, restraint, and anal play Note: This book is the first part of a trilogy that is designed to be read together, much like The Blackstone Affair. Sebastian and Sophia will get their happily ever after, but not until the last book.
