27083865:::::RoomHate:::::Sharing a summer house with a hot-as-hell roommate should be a dream come true, right? Not when it s Justin the only person I d ever loved who now hates me. When my grandmother died and left me half of the house on Aquidneck Island, there was a catch: the other half would go to the boy she helped raise. The same boy who turned into the teenager whose heart I broke years ago. The same teenager who s now a man with a hard body and a hardass personality to match. I hadn t seen him in years, and now we re living together because neither one of us is willing to give up the house. The worst part? He didn t come alone. I d soon realize there s a thin line between love and hate. I could see through that smug smile. Beneath it all the boy is still there. So is our connection. The problem is now that I can t have Justin, I ve never wanted him more. Author's note RoomHate is a full-length standalone novel.
