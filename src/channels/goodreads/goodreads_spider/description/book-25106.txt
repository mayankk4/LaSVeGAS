The book contains four tales under the banner of "Distant Mirrors", containing Issue #29 "Thermidor", #30 "August", #31 "Three Septembers and a January" and #50 "Ramadan". Three of the issues making up the "Distant Mirrors" group were published between the "Season of Mists" and "A Game of You" story arcs. The last, "Ramadan", was written contemporaneously, but because of art delays DC published it as Issue #50, after the "Brief Lives" arc. Three other issues appearing in Fables &amp; Reflections, published as the Convergence story "arc", are also single-issue short stories. "Convergence" appeared between the "A Game of You" and "Brief Lives" story arcs. It contains Issues #38 "The Hunt", #39 "Soft Places" and #40 "The Parliament of Rooks". The collection also includes the Sandman Special "The Song of Orpheus", retelling the Greek myth of Orpheus, and a brief piece from a Vertigo promotional comic.
