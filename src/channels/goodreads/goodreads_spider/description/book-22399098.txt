22399098:::::Complementary Colors:::::My sister Julia manipulated my life into a prison to keep me silent about our dirty family secret. Her greed made me a slave and circumstance left me with no way to escape. Trapped, the only way I could silence the nightmares driving me to insanity was to wrap them in color, hold them with shadow, and stitch them to negative space with line. But no matter how bright the pigments, no one could see my confession. Except for Roy Callahan. I thought he was just another nameless one-night stand in a long line of many. But I was wrong. Roy could see past the fa ade of my life and through the veil color over the canvas. He could see what the world couldn t. And with him I d find the courage to tell the truth about the boy. The boy who kissed me. The boy who loved me. The boy whose name I couldn t remember.
