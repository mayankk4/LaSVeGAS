7190:::::The Three Musketeers:::::Alexandre Dumas s most famous tale and possibly the most famous historical novel of all time in a handsome hardcover volume. This swashbuckling epic of chivalry, honor, and derring-do, set in France during the 1620s, is richly populated with romantic heroes, unattainable heroines, kings, queens, cavaliers, and criminals in a whirl of adventure, espionage, conspiracy, murder, vengeance, love, scandal, and suspense. Dumas transforms minor historical figures into larger- than-life characters: the Comte d Artagnan, an impetuous young man in pursuit of glory; the beguilingly evil seductress Milady ; the powerful and devious Cardinal Richelieu; the weak King Louis XIII and his unhappy queen and, of course, the three musketeers themselves, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, whose motto all for one, one for all has come to epitomize devoted friendship. With a plot that delivers stolen diamonds, masked balls, purloined letters, and, of course, great bouts of swordplay, The Three Musketeers is eternally entertaining.
