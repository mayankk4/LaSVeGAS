96128:::::Duck for President:::::My fellow Americans: It is our pleasure, our honor, our duty as citizens to present to you Duck for President . Here is a duck who began in a humble pond. Who worked his way to farmer. To governor. And now, perhaps, to the highest office in the land. Some say, if he walks like a duck and talks like a duck, he is a duck. We say, if he walks like a duck and talks like a duck, he will be the next president of the United States of America. Thank you for your vote.
