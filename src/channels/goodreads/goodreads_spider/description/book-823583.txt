The plan is simple: She will use every seductive wile she knows to win Dare's heart...and then break it. But his smoldering gaze once again tempts Georgiana to give in to desire and when he astonishes her with a marriage proposal, she wonders: Is he playing yet another game...or could it truly be love this time?
