12220:::::A Streetcar Named Desire:::::The Pulitzer Prize and Drama Critics Circle Award winning play reissued with an introduction by Arthur Miller ( Death of a Salesman and The Crucible ), and Williams essay The World I Live In. It is a very short list of 20th-century American plays that continue to have the same power and impact as when they first appeared 57 years after its Broadway premiere, Tennessee Williams A Streetcar Named Desire is one of those plays. The story famously recounts how the faded and promiscuous Blanche DuBois is pushed over the edge by her sexy and brutal brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski. Streetcar launched the careers of Marlon Brando, Jessica Tandy, Kim Hunter, and Karl Malden, and solidified the position of Tennessee Williams as one of the most important young playwrights of his generation, as well as that of Elia Kazan as the greatest American stage director of the 40s and 50s.
