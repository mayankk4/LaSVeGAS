9815702:::::Drink Deep:::::Clouds are brewing over Cadogan House, and recently turned vampire Merit can t tell if this is the darkness before the dawn or the calm before the storm. With the city iself in turmoil over paranormals and the state threatening to pass a paranormal registration act, times haven t been this precarious for vampires since they came out of the closet. If only they could lay low for a bit, and let the mortals calm down. That s when the waters of Lake Michigan suddenly turn pitch black-and things really start getting ugly. Chicago s mayor insists it s nothing to worry about, but Merit knows only the darkest magic could have woven a spell powerful enough to change the very fabric of nature. She ll have to turn to friends old and new to find out who s behind this, and stop them before it s too late for vampires and humans alike.
