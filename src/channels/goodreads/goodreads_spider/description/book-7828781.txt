Once they shared a brief, intense affair while Sam was undercover and then she vanished. She s spent the last months on the run, knowing that any mistake would cost her life and that of her unborn child Sam s child. Now she s resurfaced with a warning for Sam: this time, he s the one in danger. Now he s her last chance. Sam has too many questions to let her slip away again like why she disappeared in the first place. This time he vows not to be seduced. But one look in her eyes, and the passion burns again, and Sam knows he ll do anything to keep her and his child safe. However, Sophie s dark past is more dangerous than he imagines, and the only way for either to survive it is to outrun it.
