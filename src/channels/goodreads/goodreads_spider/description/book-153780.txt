153780:::::Trickster's Queen:::::The stage is set for revolution... Aly: no longer just a master spy, but a master of spies.

Dove: she has always stood in Sarai's shadow. Can she prove to the world that she herself is a force to be reckoned with? Nawat: half crow, half man. He wants Aly for his life mate, but will the revolution make that impossible as they step into new roles to change the future?
