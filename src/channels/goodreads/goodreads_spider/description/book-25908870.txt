25908870:::::Kick, Push:::::An alternate cover edition can be found here . There s a single defining moment within every skater. It lasts only a second. Two if you're good. Three if you re really good. It s the moment you re in the air, your board somewhere beneath you, and nothing but wind surrounds you. It s the feeling of being airborne. The sixteen-year-old version of me would ve said it was the greatest feeling in the world. Then at seventeen, I had my son. And every single second became a defining moment. Even the ones that consisted of heartbreak when his mother left us. Seventeen. Single. Dad. That s what my life became. Yet, every day, I managed to find that feeling of being airborne. Or at least I convinced myself I did. But I lied to myself and to everyone around me. Until she showed up; Tanned skin, raven dark hair, and eyes the color of emeralds. You know what sucks about being in the air? Coming down from the high. Sometimes you land on the board and nail the trick. Then kick, push, and coast away. Other times you fall. You fall hard. And those are the times when it s not as easy to get back up, dust off your pads and try again. Especially when the girl with the emerald eyes becomes your drug... And you become her poison.
