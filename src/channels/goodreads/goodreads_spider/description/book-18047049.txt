18047049:::::Beyond Duty:::::The repeal of Don t Ask, Don t Tell didn t come soon enough for Gunther "Gunny" Duchene and Macalister "Mac" Jones, career US Marines who met at boot camp in the 1990s. They ve been somewhere between best friends and lovers in peacetime and wartime both, but as the clock ticks toward Mac s and Gunny s retirements, the guys have much more to worry about than coming out. Whether their relationship will survive outside of the closet they ve had to shove it into for over two decades is a big question mark. After all, Gunny questions why a hot military man like Mac--who could get any guy he wanted, including a younger, sexier one--would want him. But as Gunny and Mac navigate emotional waters as choppy as any they saw on duty, they just might learn Semper Fi applies to more than their careers. This edition is the expanded novel of the short story Beyond Duty which has been included in this novel. However it has been edited and changed to 3rd person POV.
