But then Callum uncovers links between his ancient corpse and three missing young men, and life starts to get a lot more interesting. O Division s Major Investigation Teams already have more cases than they can cope with, so, against everyone s better judgement, the Misfit Mob are just going to have to manage this one on their own.
