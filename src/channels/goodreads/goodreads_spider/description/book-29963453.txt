A piece of me was stolen away, and the only person who could truly hear my silence was Brooks Griffin. He was the light during my dark days, the promise of tomorrow, until tragedy found him. Tragedy that eventually drowned him in a sea of memories. This is the story of a boy and girl who loved each other, but didn t love themselves. A story of life and death. Of love and broken promises. Of moments. (Book Three in the Elements Series. Complete Standalone. Coming Fall 2016.)
