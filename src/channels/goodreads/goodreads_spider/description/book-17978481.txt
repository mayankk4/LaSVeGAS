17978481:::::Skink--No Surrender:::::Carl Hiaasen serves up his unique brand of swamp justice in the New York Times bestseller Skink No Surrender . A National Book Award Longlist Selection When your cousin goes missing under suspicious circumstances, who do you call? There s only one man for the job: a half-crazed, half-feral, one-eyed ex-governor named Skink. Skink joins 14-year-old Richard on a breakneck chase across Florida, undaunted by lightning storms, poisonous snakes, flying bullets, and giant gators. There are a million places cousin Malley could be, a million unpleasant fates that might have befallen her, but one thing is certain: in the Florida swamp, justice is best served wild. SUNSHINE STATE AWARD FINALIST! From the Hardcover edition.
