Having no other choice, Fredrik has been keeping Cassia locked in his basement as he not only tries to get her to recall her past because she and Seraphina share it but also to protect her from Seraphina, who clearly wants her dead. But Cassia is a light in the darkness that Fredrik never believed existed. After a year subjected to her kindness and compassion, he finds himself struggling with his love for Seraphina, and his growing feelings for Cassia because he knows that to love one, the other must die.
