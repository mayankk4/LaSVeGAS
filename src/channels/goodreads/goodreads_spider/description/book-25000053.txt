25000053:::::Getting Dirty:::::Dirty A poem by Blaire Leon If sex is dirty, why would I do it with someone I love? If sex is dirty, then didn t we all come from the dirt? What if I like the dirt? What if I want to get dirty? What if I want to roll in the mud until I m so fucking filthy that I ll never be clean again? When twenty-five-year-old graduate assistant Caiden Brenner asked Blaire Leon how old she was, she said she was a senior. He chose to believe she meant in college. They connect over Lord Byron s Don Juan and, as their conversations become increasingly thicker with sexual innuendo, Caiden finds himself obsessing over a totally off-limits undergrad who s bold, beautiful, brilliant, and one of the most passionate poets he s ever met. But it turns out Blaire hasn't been totally honest. She's the seventeen-year-old valedictorian of her high school class, taking courses at Sierra State while awaiting her acceptance to Stanford. Will Caiden get too deeply into Blaire to back away before he finds out the truth? Or will their connection be enough to seduce him into risking his entire future on Jail Bait? "A thousand and one feels....Getting Dirty is a thrilling, tantalizing forbidden romance you do not want to miss! I not only devoured this book, it devoured me right back!"--Katy Evans, New York Times Bestselling author of REAL
