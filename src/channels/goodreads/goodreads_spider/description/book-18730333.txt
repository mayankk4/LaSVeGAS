18730333:::::Life's A Cappella:::::I want to tell you how great my life was. How I lived without regrets. With constant laughter. Without any tears. I want to tell you how I lived each moment to the fullest. How each breath I took was fresh and full of life. With eagerness. Without any fear. I want to tell you all of that, but then my story would be masked with lies and not worth telling. My life didn t start until I left my past. And I left everything. My mother, my friends, my name. My new name, the name everyone knows me by is Erin Lewis. Four years after finding the courage to leave her hometown in Alabama, Erin is finally happy with where her life has led her. Not only is she secure in her environment, but the relationships she has formed center her, making her forget how damaged she once was. Before she can fully settle into her new life, her past crashes into her present, unraveling a set of events that destroy the very foundation she has built her new life on.
