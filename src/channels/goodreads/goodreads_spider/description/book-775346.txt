775346:::::The Little Friend:::::Bestselling author Donna Tartt returns with a grandly ambitious and utterly riveting novel of childhood, innocence and evil. The setting is Alexandria, Mississippi, where one Mother s Day a little boy named Robin Cleve Dufresnes was found hanging from a tree in his parents yard. Twelve years later Robin s murder is still unsolved and his family remains devastated. So it is that Robin s sister Harriet - unnervingly bright, insufferably determined, and unduly influenced by the fiction of Kipling and Robert Louis Stevenson--sets out to unmask his killer. Aided only by her worshipful friend Hely, Harriet crosses her town s rigid lines of race and caste and burrows deep into her family s history of loss.
