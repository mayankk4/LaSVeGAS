27230789:::::Honestly Ben:::::Ben Carver is back to normal. He s getting all As in his classes at the Natick School. He was just elected captain of the baseball team. He s even won a big scholarship for college, if he can keep up his grades. All that foolishness with Rafe Goldberg last semester is over now, and he just needs to be a Carver, work hard, and stay focused. Except There s Hannah, a gorgeous girl who attracts him and distracts him. There s his mother, whose quiet unhappiness he s noticing for the first time. School is harder, the pressure higher, the scholarship almost slipping away. And there s Rafe, funny, kind, dating someone else and maybe the real normal that Ben needs.
