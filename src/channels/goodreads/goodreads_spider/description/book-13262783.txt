13262783:::::Every Day:::::Every day a different body. Every day a different life. Every day in love with the same girl. There s never any warning about where it will be or who it will be. A has made peace with that, even established guidelines by which to live: Never get too attached. Avoid being noticed. Do not interfere. It s all fine until the morning that A wakes up in the body of Justin and meets Justin s girlfriend, Rhiannon. From that moment, the rules by which A has been living no longer apply. Because finally A has found someone A wants to be with day in, day out, day after day.
