785453:::::A Single Shard:::::Tree-ear, an orphan, lives under a bridge in Ch ulp o, a potters village famed for delicate celadon ware. He has become fascinated with the potter s craft; he wants nothing more than to watch master potter Min at work, and he dreams of making a pot of his own someday. When Min takes Tree-ear on as his helper, Tree-ear is elated until he finds obstacles in his path: the backbreaking labor of digging and hauling clay, Min s irascible temper, and his own ignorance. But Tree-ear is determined to prove himself even if it means taking a long, solitary journey on foot to present Min s work in the hope of a royal commission . . . even if it means arriving at the royal court with nothing to show but a single celadon shard.
