65056:::::A Dog Year: Twelve Months, Four Dogs, and Me:::::Sometimes, change comes on four legs. In his popular and widely praised Running to the Mountain , Jon Katz wrote of the strength and support he found in the massive forms of his two yellow Labrador retrievers, Julius and Stanley. When the Labs were six and seven, a breeder who d read his book contacted Katz to say she had a dog that was meant for him a two-year-old border collie named Devon, well bred but high-strung and homeless. Katz already had a full canine complement but, as he writes, Change loves me. . . . It comes in all forms. . . . Sometimes, change comes on four legs. Shortly thereafter he brought Devon home. A Dog Year shows how a man discovered much about himself through one dog (and then another), whose temperament seemed as different from his own as day from night. It is a story of trust and understanding, of life and death, of continuity and change. It is by turns insightful, hilarious, and deeply moving.
