595397:::::Enthusiasm:::::Julie s best friend, Ashleigh, is an enthusiast. Julie never knows what new obsession will catch Ashleigh s fancy, but she does know she s likely to be drawn into the madness. Ashleigh s latest craze is Julie s own passion, Pride and Prejudice. But Ashleigh can t just appreciate it as a great read; she insists on emulating the novel s heroines, in speech, dress, and the most important element of all finding True Love. And so Julie finds herself with Ashleigh, dressed in vintage frocks, sneaking into a dance at the local all-boys prep school, where they discover some likely candidates. The problem with Ashleigh s craze this time, however, is that there is only one Mr. Darcy. So when the girls get a part in the boys school musical, what follows is naturally equal parts comedy and romance, as a series of misinterpreted and missed signals, dating mishaps, and awkward incidents make Julie wonder if she has the heart for True Love.
