After Kylie s dad dies in a freak accident, he leaves her with nothing other than her crazy step-mother, Darla, and the ability to play guitar. When Darla kicks Kylie out and she loses her job all in the same day, she hops a bus to Nashville determined to make her late father s dreams come true. Waitressing and saving her pennies to record a demo, her big break comes when she s asked to join a tour going down the tubes with once platinum album-selling country music superstar Trace Corbin. But touring with Trace is hardly a dream come true since he s pretty much drinking his career down the drain. If Kylie can t pull Trace out of his rut, he ll pull her and her dreams down with him.
