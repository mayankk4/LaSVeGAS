729876:::::The Devil Inside:::::Possession. Murder. Mayhem. Let the games begin... Exorcism isn t a job, it s a calling and a curse. Just ask Morgan Kingsley, a woman who has a stronger aura than any Demon. Or so she thought. Now, in a pair of black leather pants and a kick-ass tattoo, Morgan is heading back to Philadelphia after a nasty little exorcism and her life is about to be turned upside down by the Demon that s gotten inside her. Not just any Demon. Six foot five inches of dark, delicious temptation, this one is to die for that is, if he doesn t get Morgan killed first. Because while some humans vilify Demons and others idolize them, Morgan s Demon is leading a war of succession no human has ever imagined. For a woman trying to live a life, and hold on to the almost-perfect man, being possessed by a gorgeous rebel Demon will mean a wild ride of uninhibited thrills, shocking surprises, and pure, unadulterated terror.
