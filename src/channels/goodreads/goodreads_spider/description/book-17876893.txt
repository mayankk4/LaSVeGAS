17876893:::::Captivated by You:::::Gideon calls me his angel, but he s the miracle in my life. My gorgeous, wounded warrior, so determined to slay my demons while refusing to face his own. The vows we d exchanged should have bound us tighter than blood and flesh. Instead they opened old wounds, exposed pain and insecurities, and lured bitter enemies out of the shadows. I felt him slipping from my grasp, my greatest fears becoming my reality, my love tested in ways I wasn t sure I was strong enough to bear. At the brightest time in our lives, the darkness of his past encroached and threatened everything we d worked so hard for. We faced a terrible choice: the familiar safety of the lives we d had before each other or the fight for a future that suddenly seemed an impossible and hopeless dream.
