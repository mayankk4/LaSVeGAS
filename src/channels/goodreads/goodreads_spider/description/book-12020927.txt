12020927:::::Blood in the Skies:::::G.D. Falksen's steampunk epic launches with Blood In The Skies. In 1908, the world ended in fire. Humanity, always bad at following orders, refused to die. Now, two hundred years later, what remains is divided between civilized order and lawless frontier. For the citizens of the Commonwealth, the brave pilots of the Air Force are all that stand between them and the dreaded pirate lords of the Badlands. For generations, the two forces have struggled back and forth in an endless cycle of invasion and reprisal. Now that is about to change, and flying ace Elizabeth Steele is about to find herself dragged into a web of intrigue aimed at the downfall of the civilized world. Nothing that a clever girl with a trusty aeroplane and a charming spy at her side can't handle. "This is steampunk clanking to life on the page." --Jay Lake "G. D. Falksen's witty, anachronistic, and downright fun writing style makes him a storyteller to watch." --Terrance Zdunich (REPO! The Genetic Opera) "A piston blast of pure pulp adventure" --John Leavitt (Dr. Sketchy's Official Rainy Day Colouring Book) "A rousing adventure filled with a wealth of imagery, action and technological wonders." --Chet Phillips "G.D. Falksen is not only one of the most important authors in Steampunk literature, he is arguably the most enjoyable." --Art Donovan (The Art of Steampunk) "A delightfully crunchy alternate reality that lets you feel the gears grinding." --Phil Foglio (Girl Genius)
