22820741:::::Six of Hearts:::::Step right up and meet Jay Fields: Illusionist. Mentalist. Trickster. I think in triangles. You think in straight lines. I show you a table and make you believe it s a chair. Smoke and mirrors, sleight of hand, misdirection. I trick and deceive. But most of all, I put on a good show. The world thinks I killed a man, but I didn t. Bear with me. It s all a part of the plan. Revenge is what I want. I want it for me and I want it for her. I want it for all six of us. She doesn t remember me, but she s the reason for everything. She ll be my prize at the end of all this if I can hold onto my willpower, that is. Maybe I ll slip up a little, have a taste, just a small one. So go ahead and pick a card. Come inside and see the show. Look at my hands, look so closely that you can t see what s happening while you re so focused on looking. I ll be destroying your world from right here in the spotlight. You ll never see me coming until it s too late. I ve only got one heart, and after I ve pulled off my grand deception I ll hand it right to her. So, sit back, relax, and let my girl tell you our story. You re in for one hell of a ride. **Suitable for readers 18 years and over. Contains sex scenes and adult language.**
