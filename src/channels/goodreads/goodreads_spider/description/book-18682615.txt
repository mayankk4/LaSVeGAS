18682615:::::The Coveted:::::In places that know more about heaven and hell than we do, you have a reputation, Gabrielle. To them you are known as the devil s consort. When a body shows up near Peel Academy, all signs indicate the killer is a vampire. Ravaged throat, body drained of blood. At least that s all it appears to be when the Politia, the supernatural police force, assigns Gabrielle to the case. Now it s Gabrielle s job to figure out who did it. But after a second body turns up with the same lethal wounds, it s clear that a serial killer is stalking the island. The murders have compromised the truce between the Politia and vampires, and as long as the killer roams free, it is in danger of dissolving. If that happens, no vampire is safe from persecution, not even Gabrielle. Now Gabrielle must team up with Andre, her soulmate and the one person she s tried to stay away from, to investigate the murders before the truce dissolves. And keeping her distance is proving to be impossible. But Gabrielle has a bigger problem. The world of the dead know about her, and their whispers hint that something is coming for her. And it s coming soon.
