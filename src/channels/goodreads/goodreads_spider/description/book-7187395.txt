You have no idea how far I ve come or what I ve lost. More important, you have no idea what I ve found." Prologue What would you do if you lost everything your job, your home, and the love of your life all at the same time? When it happens to Seattle ad executive Alan Christoffersen, he s tempted by his darkest thoughts. A bottle of pills in his hand and nothing left to live for, he plans to end his misery. Instead, he decides to take a walk. But not any ordinary walk.

The people he encounters along the way, and the lessons they share with him, will save his life and inspire yours. Richard Paul Evans s extraordinary New York Times bestsellers have made him one of the world s most beloved storytellers. A life-changing journey, both physical and spiritual, The Walk is the first of an unforgettable series of books about one man s search for hope.
