29806565:::::Mr and Mrs:::::Welcome to Alexa Riley Promises. This series is dedicated to old romances. It s tropes galore, with all of our usual over-the-top alphas and sweet cheesy goodness. These short books will focus on traditional and classic tropes while sticking to the Alexa Riley code: no cheating and always with an HEA. That s our Promise to you. Mr and Mrs Phillip has been married to Molly for a year. He s beyond obsessed with his new wife, to the point that he has to hold his true feelings back. If she knew how crazy he is for her, she might push him away. Molly is feeling distance growing between them, and she s worried she s not enough. One night she walks in on Phillip, and it changes everything. When Phillip discovers Molly was in an accident and now has amnesia, he s going to do all he can to make her fall in love with him again. Holding nothing back this time. Warning: It s just as crazy as it sounds and just as over-the-top ridiculous. If you want to get silly with us and spend a little time away from reality, grab this one up!
