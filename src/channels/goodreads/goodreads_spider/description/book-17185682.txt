17185682:::::Shadowed:::::Jase Kayrs was the fun brother. The warm, charming, easy-going brother of the vampire leaders. Until he was taken and tortured by demons with their evil mind tricks for nearly five years. Upon his return, he s dark, violent, and not the man they all thought they knew. Not the man he once was. He s haunted that the only reason the demons would have let him live was to use him as a weapon against his family but he can t figure out when or how he ll explode. Plus, once again the demons are after Jase with a vengeance or rather, a female demon he rejected is out to destroy him. Then the king asks Jase for a favor a big one. To mate with one of their allies in order to save her. She s everything that s good and light in the world while he s at home with darkness. Yet he agrees knowing mating may be the only chance to save them both.
