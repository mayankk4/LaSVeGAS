So Sam joins the first-ever class of girls at the prestigious Denmark Military Academy. She s expecting push-ups and long runs, rope climbing and mud-crawling. As a military brat, she can handle an obstacle course just as well as the boys. She's even expecting the hostility she gets from some of the cadets who don t think girls belong there. What she s not expecting is her fiery attraction to her drill sergeant. But dating is strictly forbidden and Sam won't risk her future, or the dare, on something so petty... no matter how much she wants him. As Sam struggles to prove herself, she discovers that some of the boys don t just want her gone they will stop at nothing to drive her out. When their petty threats turn to brutal hazing, bleeding into every corner of her life, she realizes they are not acting alone. A decades-old secret society is alive and active and determined to force her out. At any cost. Now time's running short. Sam must decide who she can trust... and choosing the wrong person could have deadly consequences.
