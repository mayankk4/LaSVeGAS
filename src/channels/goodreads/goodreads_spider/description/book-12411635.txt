But when Dusty sneaks into Eli Booker s house, things get a whole lot more complicated. He s hot, which means sitting on his chest and invading his dreams couldn t get much more embarrassing. But it does. Eli is dreaming of a murder. Then Eli s dream comes true. Now Dusty has to follow the clues both within Eli s dreams and out of them to stop the killer before more people turn up dead. And before the killer learns what she s up to and marks her as the next target.
