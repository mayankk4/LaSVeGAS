55354:::::Napalm & Silly Putty:::::I THINK I AM, THEREFORE I AM. I THINK. In Napalm &amp; Silly Putty , George Carlin, the thinking person's comic, offers a hilarious new collection of razor-sharp observations on God, language, death, pets, driving, food, sports, airplanes, advertising, news, businessmen, and much, much more! * Just when I discovered the meaning of life, they changed it. * If people climb Mt. Everest because it's hard to do, why do they go up on the easy side? * With a little effort, oxen can be trained to genuflect and whistle softly in the moonlight. * How can it be a spy satellite if they announce on TV that its a spy satellite? * If people stand in a circle long enough, they will eventually begin to dance. * Guys don't seem to be called "Lefty" anymore. * No one quite knows what's next, but everybody does it. * I think it would be great if you could make a guy's head explode just by staring at him. * Am I the only one who's noticed that the Lone Ranger and Tonto never got their laundry done? You'll learn what Carlin thinks of saving the planet, his suggestion for revamping the prison system, and why he prays to Joe Pesci. Add to the mix "The Ten Most Embarrassing Songs of All Time," "The 20th Century Hostility Scoreboard," and "People I Can Do Without," and you have an irresistible assortment of quips, probes, thrusts, and verbal ordeals that are as smart as they are infectiously funny.
