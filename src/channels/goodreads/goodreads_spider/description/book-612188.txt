612188:::::Memories, Dreams, Reflections:::::In the spring of 1957, when he was eighty-one years old, C. G. Jung undertook the telling of his life story. At regular intervals he had conversations with his colleague and friend Aniela Jaff , and collaborated with her in the preparation of the text based on these talks. On occasion, he was moved to write entire chapters of the book in his own hand, and he continued to work on the final stages of the manuscript until shortly before his death on June 6, 1961. This edition of Memories, Dreams, Reflections includes Jung's VII Sermones ad Mortuos . It is a fully corrected edition.
