18685332:::::Fire of Stars and Dragons:::::A dragon's fire cannot be tamed. In 22nd century sovereign America, women should be seen and not heard. Unfortunately, twenty-one-year-old CAITRIONA HAYDEN didn't get that memo! Determined to make her way in the world following the death of her uncle, being "seen" is the least of Cait's problems. Someone's trying to kill her. Ordained to guard and protect her, when Theo Pendragon claims Cait as his ward, he finds more than he expects as the flames of passion ignite within the dragon for the first time. But Theo is not alone in his desire, and he must learn to fight for what he wants, even if it costs him his best friend. Dante, a powerful demigod and beloved friend to Theo, has spent centuries pursuing intellectual endeavors rather than indulging in the heat of desire. But everything changes when Cait arouses an attraction he cannot deny. But Dante isn't the only one with a vested interest in Cait's future. America's monarch, an ancient vampire named Corrin, puts no stock in the frivolity of love, and yet a proper queen would boost his approval rating amongst the people. Marrying Cait could hold the key to his survival. Now, love, desire and need force Cait into an impossible situation with dire consequences. Soon, Cait goes from studying for college exams to fighting for a future she never knew she wanted with a man she never imagined she could love. But the key to her future is held in the one secret she has yet to uncover.
