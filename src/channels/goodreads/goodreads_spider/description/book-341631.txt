341631:::::After the Ecstasy, the Laundry: How the Heart Grows Wise on the Spiritual Path:::::Enlightenment does exist, internationally renowned author and meditation master Jack Kornfield assures us. Unbounded freedom and joy, oneness with the divine ... these experiences are more common than you know, and not far away. But even after achieving such realization after the ecstasy we are faced with the day-to-day task of translating that freedom into our imperfect lives. We are faced with the laundry. Drawing on the experiences and insights of leaders and practitioners within the Buddhist, Christian, Jewish, Hindu, and Sufi traditions, this book offers a uniquely intimate and honest understanding of how the modern spiritual journey unfolds and how we can prepare our hearts for awakening. Through moving personal stories and traditional tales, we learn how the enlightened heart navigates the real world of family relationships, emotional pain, earning a living, sickness, loss, and death.
