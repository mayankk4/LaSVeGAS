11324722:::::The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion:::::This well-researched examination of human moral impulses will appeal to liberals and conservatives alike following the 2016 presidential campaign and election. As America descends deeper into polarization and paralysis, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt has done the seemingly impossible challenged conventional thinking about morality, politics, and religion in a way that speaks to everyone on the political spectrum. Drawing on his twenty five years of groundbreaking research on moral psychology, he shows how moral judgments arise not from reason but from gut feelings. He shows why liberals, conservatives, and libertarians have such different intuitions about right and wrong, and he shows why each side is actually right about many of its central concerns. In this subtle yet accessible book, Haidt gives you the key to understanding the miracle of human cooperation, as well as the curse of our eternal divisions and conflicts. If you re ready to trade in anger for understanding, read The Righteous Mind. A groundbreaking investigation into the origins of morality, which turns out to be the basis for religion and politics. The book is timely (explaining the American culture wars and refuting the "New Atheists"), scholarly (integrating insights from many fields) and great fun to read (like Haidt's last book, The Happiness Hypothesis ).
