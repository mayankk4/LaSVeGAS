21363389:::::Target This:::::I m not sure what I was thinking that day. It was a normal Thursday, nothing new or exciting had occurred in the morning. I d risen from bed, taken a shower and brushed my teeth. I d then jumped on the 8:05 bus that ran a short distance between my house and the county library where I worked. The ride took its usual 15 minutes before it left me standing fresh faced in front of a building of gothic construction that was my favorite place in the world. After straightening my knee length skirt, I pushed open the door that led into the interior of the library. It was at that moment that my world would change impossibly and forever. It was a fateful movement of wood that collided with the shoulder of a man that would alter my very existence. It wasn t fear that I felt at that moment more like the feeling of being watched. It was the feeling of knowing that danger lurks - the sensation of the hair standing on end at the back of your neck. Looking back on a moment that happened so many months ago, I now realize that I should have listened to that feeling. As I would later find out, the man standing in front of me referred to himself as Master Lucas and I was his next target.
