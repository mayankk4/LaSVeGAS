22319080:::::The Blood Alchemist:::::Master alchemist Addie Daulton hasn t always done the right thing. To atone for sins from her forgotten past, and earn back the respect of the people she loves, she decides to show the world that alchemy can be used for good. For healing. But she can t do anything without a lab. Desperate, she teams up with a new partner whose lab has everything she needs, but does she dare work with a man whose reputation is even darker than her own? The risk proves worth it when she lands a contract to make burn salve for a local hospital. Things are looking up until Rowan, the leader of the magical community and her former lover, returns and demands her assistance. The magical are being gunned down, and cryptic messages are being left at the murder scenes. Messages that point a finger at alchemy and her. The connection begins to make sense when she discovers that the bullets from the crime scenes have been altered with blood alchemy and that the design is her own. Working with Rowan won t be easy, not just because of their lost love, but because her new business partner once tried to kill him. If Rowan finds out who he really is, Addie s involvement in the investigation will be over. She can t let Rowan shut her out again. Not when he might be the killer s next target.
