906560:::::Tramp for the Lord:::::For the past twenty years Corrie ten Boom has crisscrossed the globe, slept in more than a thousand different beds, and lived out of suitcases...all to fulfill her God-given mission to tell people everywhere that Jesus Christ is reality, that He Lives, that He is Victor. This remarkable woman of eighty-one years served time in a German concentration camp during World War II for the "crime" of hiding persecuted Jews and survived to tell the story in her best selling book, The Hiding Place. Her brush with death lent a new meaning to her life. In her own words: "My life had been given back as a gift...for a purpose." After her release from the concentration camp, Corrie ten Boom set out to become what she calls a "tramp for the Lord," traveling around the world at the direction of God, proclaiming His message everywhere. And through her lifelong experiences, she has learned a few lessons in God's great classroom which she shares with the readers of Tramp For the Lord. So deeply has she touched the hearts of men and women during her years of ministry that she is known as the venerable "Double-old Grandmother" and "Tante" Corrie to them. And she , in turn, has been touched and taught by them. Let her introduce you to... -her former prison guard who asks her for forgiveness...a forgiveness that come hard and with much pain... -the war-crippled lawyer with a soul that was as twisted and deformed as his limbs... -an African who truly followed Christ's exhortation to forgive your neighbor seventy times seven (Matt. 18:22)... -the travel agent who learned that her ultimate destination could not be found on any map... -a missionary mother whose unwanted babe ended up saving her life... All these touchingly human vignettes from her life and travels are intertwined with the unique teaching trouch that has sustained Corrie throughout her days.
