36411879:::::The Mafia And His Angel: Part 2:::::Ayla The darkness never truly left me. It s always there, waiting for the right moment to strike. It s been months since I ran away from the nightmare that was slowly killing me. I ran for my life, straight into the arms of a man who I thought would be worse than the nightmare I d left behind. Little did I know he d become my savior. But my happy ending was ripped away from me in a blink of an eye. I had everything and I lost everything. Alessio I didn t believe in angels. But then I saw her. I touched her. I kissed her. I made love to her. In return, she saved my soul. I was no longer unlovable, because my Angel found it in her heart to love me. I had her and then I lost her. But I will not stop until I find her. Even if it means starting a war and spilling the blood of everyone who gets in my way. I will find my Angel.
