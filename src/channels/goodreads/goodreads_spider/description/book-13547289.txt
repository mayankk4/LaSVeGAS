And there just might be some juicy info involving Nikki s crush, Brandon, that Nikki doesn t want Mackenzie reporting to the world. So Nikki joins the school newspaper staff and ends up as an advice columnist! It s fun at first, answering other kids letters. But when Miss Know-It-All s inbox is suddenly overflowing with pleas for guidance, Nikki feels in need of some help herself. Fortunately she has BFFs Chloe and Zoey on her side and at her keyboard!
