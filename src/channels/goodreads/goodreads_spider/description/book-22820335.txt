22820335:::::Amatore's Restaurant:::::It is the end of another successful year for the Recreative Theatre Company and the cast have arranged to meet at Ristorante Amatore for their end-of-season dinner. As the evening progresses, each guest recalls a past sexual liaison. In these recollections we are transported to a variety of locations; the rolling countryside of Brittany to the brown caf s of Amsterdam, from the grandeur of Venice to the slums of Marseilles. The stories describe various situations: Prudence relates her encounters on a train journey and Colin makes a surprising discovery when he settles down to watch his favourite film. Some characters are driven by self-interest: the sociopath Nicole with her reckless behaviour towards her trusting nephew, and Colette who takes advantage of her unsuspecting tenant. A common theme unfolds: the hidden truths behind the motives for seduction. As the evening comes to a close, old alliances are re-kindled, new attachments are formed, while others are broken. Frustrations rise to the surface as truths are revealed. For some the evening is a great success, for others a disaster. WARNING: Adult content; there are passages which describe sex explicitly.
