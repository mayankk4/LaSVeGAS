568104:::::Ironhand's Daughter:::::The armies of the Outlanders crushed the highlanders at the battle of Colden Moor killing their finest warriors and breaking their freeborn spirit. The highlanders are now a conquered people, ruled by the brutal Baron Gottasson. Prophecies speak of the coming of a new leader, a descendent of Ironhand, mightiest of the highland kings. A leader who will throw off the Outlander yoke. But only one highlander carries the blood of Ironhand: Sigarni, a wild and willful teenage girl who cares for nothing save her own concerns. Until a fateful encounter thrusts her onto a path of rebellion. Now, hunted by the baron s soldiers and stalked by an evil sorcerer, Sigarni will be forced to fulfill her destiny . . . or perish.
