25526296:::::Every Heart a Doorway:::::Eleanor West s Home for Wayward Children No Solicitations No Visitors No Quests Children have always disappeared under the right conditions; slipping through the shadows under a bed or at the back of a wardrobe, tumbling down rabbit holes and into old wells, and emerging somewhere... else. But magical lands have little need for used-up miracle children. Nancy tumbled once, but now she s back. The things she s experienced... they change a person. The children under Miss West s care understand all too well. And each of them is seeking a way back to their own fantasy world. But Nancy s arrival marks a change at the Home. There s a darkness just around each corner, and when tragedy strikes, it s up to Nancy and her new-found schoolmates to get to the heart of the matter. No matter the cost.
