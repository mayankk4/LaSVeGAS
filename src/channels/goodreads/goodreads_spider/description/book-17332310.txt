17332310:::::Kiss of the Night:::::What do you get when you have an immortal Viking warrior no one can remember five minutes after he leaves their presence, and a demon on the run for her life who is being pursued by one seriously pissed-off demigod? That would be my life. It started out simple enough. One night I went to save a woman in trouble. The next thing I knew, the doorway to hell had opened and out stepped Daimons- soul-sucking vampires the likes of which I d never seen before. Led by the son of Apollo, they are out to end the curse that has banished them all to darkness. The only problem with that is they have to kill Cassandra Peters to do it and if she dies, so dies the sun, the earth and all who dwell here. Life s just a bowl full of cherries, ain t it? Brought together by fate, it s now my job to protect a daughter of the very race I have been hunting for centuries. Neither of us dares to trust the other. But if we don t find a way to overcome our differences and to bridge thousands of years of animosity, we won t die alone. We ll take the entire world with us. Wulf Tryggvasen
