230852:::::City of Saints and Madmen:::::In City of Saints and Madmen , Jeff VanderMeer has reinvented the literature of the fantastic. You hold in your hands an invitation to a place unlike any you ve ever visited an invitation delivered by one of our most audacious and astonishing literary magicians. City of elegance and squalor. Of religious fervor and wanton lusts. And everywhere, on the walls of courtyards and churches, an incandescent fungus of mysterious and ominous origin. In Ambergris, a would-be suitor discovers that a sunlit street can become a killing ground in the blink of an eye. An artist receives an invitation to a beheading and finds himself enchanted. And a patient in a mental institution is convinced he s made up a city called Ambergris, imagined its every last detail, and that he s really from a place called Chicago. By turns sensuous and terrifying, filled with exotica and eroticism, this interwoven collection of stories, histories, and eyewitness reports invokes a universe within a puzzlebox where you can lose and find yourself again.
