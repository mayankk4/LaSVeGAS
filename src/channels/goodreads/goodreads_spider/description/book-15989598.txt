In Paris there are no grand balls or glittering parties, and, disturbingly, the house Ingrid s twin brother, Grayson, found for them isn t a house at all. It s an abandoned abbey, its roof lined with stone gargoyles that could almost be mistaken for living, breathing creatures. And Grayson has gone missing. No one seems to know of his whereabouts but Luc, a devastatingly handsome servant at their new home. Ingrid is sure her twin isn t dead she can feel it deep in her soul but she knows he s in grave danger. It will be up to her and Gabby to navigate the twisted path to Grayson, a path that will lead Ingrid on a discovery of dark secrets and otherworldly truths. And she ll learn that once they are uncovered, they can never again be buried.
