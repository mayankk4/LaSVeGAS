18628601:::::More Than Forever:::::-LUCY- There is a love so fierce it cannot be measured. A heart so strong it will never slow. There is a promise so sure it can never lie. He promised me that love forever. Even when it wasn't enough. -CAMERON- Forever. Everlasting. Eternal. There is no measure of time. No sounds of the ticking of a clock. Just the rising and falling of the sun. And our own sense of forever. But our forever isn't always.
