7614747:::::Venom:::::What kind of assassin works pro bono? It s hard to be a badass assassin when a giant is beating the crap out of you. Luckily, I never let pride get in the way of my work. My current mission is personal: annihilate Mab Monroe, the Fire elemental who murdered my family. Which means protecting my identity, even if I have to conceal my powerful Stone and Ice magic when I need it most. To the public, I m Gin Blanco, owner of Ashland s best barbecue joint. To my friends, I m the Spider, retired assassin. I still do favors on the side. Like ridding a vampire friend of her oversized stalker Mab s right-hand goon who almost got me dead with his massive fists. At least irresistible Owen Grayson is on my side. The man knows too much about me, but I ll take my chances. Then there s Detective Bria Coolidge, one of Ashland s finest. Until recently, I thought my baby sister was dead. She probably thinks the same about me. Little does she know, I m a cold-blooded killer . . . who is about to save her life.
