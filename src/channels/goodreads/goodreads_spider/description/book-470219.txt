470219:::::I Was a Rat!:::::I Was a Rat! So insists a scruffy boy named Roger. Maybe it s true. But what is he now? A terrifying monster running wild in the sewers? The Daily Scourge is sure of it. A victim of Rodent Delusion ? The hospital nurse says yes. A lucrative fairground freak? He is to Mr. Tapscrew. A champion wriggler and a budding thief? That s what Billy thinks. Or just an ordinary small boy, though a little ratty in his habits? Only three people believe this version of the story. And it may take a royal intervention and a bit of magic to convince the rest of the world. Set against the backdrop of a Royal Wedding and a playful parody of the press, I Was a Rat! is a magical weaving of humor, fairy tale, and adventure.
