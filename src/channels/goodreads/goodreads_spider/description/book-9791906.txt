9791906:::::52 Reasons to Hate My Father:::::Being America s favorite heiress is a dirty job, but someone s gotta do it. Lexington Larrabee has never to work a day in her life. After all, she s the heiress to the multi-billion-dollar Larrabee Media empire. And heiresses are not supposed to work. But then again, they re not supposed to crash brand new Mercedes convertibles into convenience stores on Sunset Blvd either. Which is why, on Lexi s eighteen birthday, her ever-absent, tycoon father decides to take a more proactive approach to her wayward life. Every week for the next year, she will have to take on a different low-wage job if she ever wants to receive her beloved trust fund. But if there s anything worse than working as a maid, a dishwasher, and a fast-food restaurant employee, it s dealing with Luke, the arrogant, albeit moderately attractive, college intern her father has assigned to keep tabs on her. In a hilarious comedy of heiress about family, forgiveness, good intentions, and best of all, second chances, Lexi learns that love can be unconditional, money can be immaterial, and, regardless of age, everyone needs a little saving. And although she might have 52 reasons to hate her father, she only needs one reason to love him.
