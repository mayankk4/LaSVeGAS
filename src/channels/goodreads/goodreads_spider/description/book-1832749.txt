1832749:::::I Heart You, You Haunt Me:::::Girl meets boy. Girl loses boy. Girl gets boy back... ..sort of. Ava can't see him or touch him, unless she's dreaming. She can't hear his voice, except for the faint whispers in her mind. Most would think she's crazy, but she knows he's here. Jackson. The boy Ava thought she'd spend the rest of her life with. He's back from the dead, as proof that love truly knows no bounds.
