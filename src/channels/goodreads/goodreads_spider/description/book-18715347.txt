18715347:::::Must Love Otters:::::Hollie Porter is the chairwoman of Generation Disillusioned: at twenty-five years old, she s saddled with a job she hates, a boyfriend who s all wrong for her, and a vexing inability to say no. She s already near her breaking point, so when one caller too many kicks the bucket during Hollie s 911 shift, she cashes in the Sweethearts Spa &amp; Stay gift certificate from her dad and heads to Revelation Cove, British Columbia. One caveat: she s going solo. Any sweethearts will have to be found on site. Hollie hopes to find her beloved otters in the wilds of the Great White North, but instead she s providing comic relief for staff and guests alike. Even Concierge Ryan, a former NHL star with bad knees and broken dreams, can t stop her from stumbling from one (mis)adventure to another. Just when Hollie starts to think that a change of venue doesn t mean a change in circumstances, the island works its charm and she starts to think she might have found the rejuvenation she so desperately desires. But then an uninvited guest crashes the party, forcing her to step out of the discomfort zone where she dwells and save the day and maybe even herself in the process.
