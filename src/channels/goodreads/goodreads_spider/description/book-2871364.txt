No one knew that better than FBI special agent Smoky Barrett. But what secret was a very private young woman keeping that led to her very public murder? And what kind of killer was so driven and so brazenly daring that he d take her life on a commercial airliner thirty thousand feet in midair, a killer so accomplished that he d leave only a small souvenir behind?

For in his eyes no one is innocent; everyone harbors a secret sin, including Smoky Barrett. Soon Smoky will have to face what she s so carefully hidden even from her own team and confront a flawless killer who knows her flaws with murderous intimacy. From the Hardcover edition.
