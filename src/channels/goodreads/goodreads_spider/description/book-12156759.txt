12156759:::::Bear, Otter, and the Kid:::::Three years ago, Bear McKenna s mother took off for parts unknown with her new boyfriend, leaving Bear to raise his six-year-old brother Tyson, aka the Kid. Somehow they ve muddled through, but since he s totally devoted to the Kid, Bear isn t actually doing much living with a few exceptions, he s retreated from the world, and he s mostly okay with that. Until Otter comes home. Otter is Bear s best friend s older brother, and as they ve done for their whole lives, Bear and Otter crash and collide in ways neither expect. This time, though, there s nowhere to run from the depth of emotion between them. Bear still believes his place is as the Kid s guardian, but he can t help thinking there could be something more for him in the world... something or someone.
