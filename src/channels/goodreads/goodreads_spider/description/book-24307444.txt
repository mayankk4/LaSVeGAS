24307444:::::Volition:::::You know that feeling in the pit of your stomach that stays with you, then tears you apart slowly at first, and all at once shreds every fiber of your being? It s because you re contradicting the universe. Everything lines up so perfectly that you couldn t have imagined it to work out better, but then you have to go and do everything humanly possible to ruin it because you can t stand to have it go right? That s what I did. I did it because there s a darkness that surrounds me, and I think I want it there. My name is Tate McKenna, and my soul is blacker than my heart.
