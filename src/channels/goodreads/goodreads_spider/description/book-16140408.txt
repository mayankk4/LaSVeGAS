16140408:::::Down London Road:::::Johanna Walker is used to taking charge. But she s about to meet someone who will make her lose control... It has always been up to Johanna to care for her family, particularly her younger brother, Cole. With an absent father and a useless mother, she s been making decisions based on what s best for Cole for as long as she can remember. She even determines what men to date by how much they can provide for her brother and her, not on whatever sparks may or may not fly. But with Cameron MacCabe, the attraction is undeniable. The sexy new bartender at work gives her butterflies every time she looks at him. And for once, Jo is tempted to put her needs first. Cam is just as obsessed with getting to know Jo, but her walls are too solid to let him get close enough to even try. Then Cam moves into the flat below Jo s, and their blistering connection becomes impossible to ignore. Especially since Cam is determined to uncover all of Jo s secrets... even if it means taking apart her defenses piece by piece.
