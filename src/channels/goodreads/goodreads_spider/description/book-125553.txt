125553:::::Welcome to Dead House:::::Amanda and Josh think the old house they have just moved into is weird. Spooky. Possibly haunted. And the town of Dark Falls is pretty strange, too. But their parents don't believe them. You'll get used to it, they say. Go out and make some new friends. So Amanda and Josh do. But these creepy new friends are not exactly what their parents had in mind. Because they want to be friends... ...Forever.
