16093188:::::Up to Me:::::For Olivia, romantic bliss has never felt so right as it does with Cash. Unpredictable, except when it comes to satisfying her desires, Cash s bad boy reputation is well-earned, but he s turning his life around with the one woman who accepts him for who he is. Until strangers from the past turn Olivia and Cash s world upside down. What they want is something only Cash can give them. And if he doesn t deliver, then they re taking the one thing that Cash values the most. Olivia always knew that in falling for Cash she was likely to get burned. But this new threat is beyond anything she imagined. Now she has to trust Cash with her life and for Olivia that s much easier than letting go, and trusting him with her heart.
