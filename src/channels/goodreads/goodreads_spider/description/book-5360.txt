5360:::::A Painted House:::::Until that September of 1952, Luke Chandler had never kept a secret or told a single lie.

And suddenly mysteries are flooding Luke s world. A brutal murder leaves the town seething in gossip and suspicion. A beautiful young woman ignites forbidden passions. A fatherless baby is born ... and someone has begun furtively painting the bare clapboards of the Chandler farmhouse, slowly, painstakingly, bathing the run-down structure in gleaming white. And as young Luke watches the world around him, he unravels secrets that could shatter lives and change his family and his town forever.... From the Paperback edition.
