487666:::::Beyond Band of Brothers: The War Memoirs of Major Dick Winters:::::They were called Easy Company but their mission was never easy. Immortalized as the Band of Brothers , they suffered 150% casualties while liberating Europe an unparalleled record of bravery under fire. Dick Winters was their commander "the best combat leader in World War II" to his men. This is his story told in his own words for the first time. On D-Day, Dick Winters parachuted into France and assumed leadership of the Band of Brothers when their commander was killed. He led them through the Battle of the Bulge and into Germany, by which time each member had been wounded. They liberated an S.S. death camp from the horrors of the Holocaust and captured Berchtesgaden, Hitler's alpine retreat. After briefly serving during the Korean War, Winters was a highly successful businessman. Made famous by Stephen Ambrose's book Band of Brothers and the subsequent award-winning HBO miniseries he is the object of worldwide adulation, Beyond Band of Brothers is Winters's memoir based on his wartime diary but it also includes his comrades' untold stories. Virtually all this material is being released for the first time. Only Winters was present from the activation of Easy Company until the war's end. Winner of the Distinguished Service Cross, only he could pen this moving tribute to the human spirit.
