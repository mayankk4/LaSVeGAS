17788557:::::Redesigned:::::While fashion design major Caroline Hunter may have been born economically unlucky, in college, she s been lucky in love. Until her senior year at Southern University. She s gone from a serious long term boyfriend to a string of crappy dates. Then she meets mathematics grad student Reed Pendergraft. Reed is everything she s not looking for. Serious. Headed for a low paying university job. Boring. Caroline spent the first eighteen years of her life wondering where her next meal was coming from. She sure wasn t getting trapped in that life again with a man living on a professor s salary. An encounter with Reed in a club proves she might have pegged him wrong. He brings out a lusty side she never knew she had. But just when she s about to give in to her hormones, Reed makes a fool out of her. When she shows up for the first committee meeting for Southern University s Fall fashion show, a fundraiser for underprivileged kids, Caroline s horrified to discover the insufferable Reed is the committee chairman. While she refuses to tolerate his totalitarian rule of the committee, she s not sure she ll survive the month with her heart and her pride intact. Just when she thinks she has everything figured out, she finds that her entire life has been redesigned, thanks to Reed Pendergraft.
