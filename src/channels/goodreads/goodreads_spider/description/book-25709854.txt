Loving fast and hard has always been Mason s philosophy. He doesn t want a meaningless connection, he wants it all, and he wants it with Brooke. When she makes her one desire known to hit it and quit it Mason wages a plan to ensure Brooke keeps coming back for more. Or so he hopes. Getting her attention was the easy part.
