31216203:::::Just Friends:::::It s the end of summer. Just before I start senior year with my two best friends in the whole world. Dustin and Emily are everything to me. We ve been inseparable since middle school, and when we re together, nothing can go wrong. But things aren t always what they seem. Em s turned into a drunken mess who parties too much. Dustin and I have hooked up a few times and now he s ready to take our relationship to the next level. Yet I m not sure I want things to change. I m scared if I take it any further with Dustin, our friendship will be ruined forever. Then there s Ryan. The new guy. He s hot. He flirts way too much. And Em has totally set her sights on him. So when my best friend betrays me in the worst possible way, guess who s there to help me pick up the pieces of my broken heart? Ryan. But he s so confusing. Annoying. Sweet. Sexy. I want to trust him, yet he makes it so hard. What I really want is for everything to go back to the way it was before. Before I found out that best friends make the worst kind of enemies.
