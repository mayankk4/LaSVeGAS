When she discovers that her attacker is her own brother, Lucas, who disappeared four years ago, Lily refuses to believe that her brother would truly hurt her and becomes determined to find Lucas and bring him home. Lily finds that Lucas disappearance is somehow tied to Tharin; so when he informs her that she is his betrothed and must return with him to Velesi, fulfill a treaty between their families and unite the two strongest clans through their marriage, Lily agrees. However, she s not going to Velesi for a wedding, but to bring home her only family, Lucas. On their journey to the borders of Velesi, the realm of the Thirteen Clans, they re pursued by a Sidhe assassin group call the Ange, meet with an ogre crime lord that ends badly, deal with a sleazy troll motel manager, and when they discover that there s a bounty on their heads, they must keep one step ahead of every assassin, bounty hunter and low-life criminal in Velesi. Protecting Lily has become the biggest challenge of Tharin s life. Lucky for him he has help in the form of his twin brother, Tolan, Lily s best friend Julia and his three bodyguard cousins.
