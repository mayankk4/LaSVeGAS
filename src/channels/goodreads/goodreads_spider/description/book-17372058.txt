17372058:::::Tease:::::When Jonathan was gone I couldn t stop thinking about him, and the first thing he did when he got back was demand more of me. I m willing to give him my orgasms and my time, but I find myself giving up pieces of my heart. My career is on track, and even though I can t write a thing, I can sing. So I ll go to the art opening with him, because his ex wife will be there. I feel this need to protect him from hurt, though in bed, his domination brings me to my knees. This man is going to break me into a million little pieces.
