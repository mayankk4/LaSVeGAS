What happens in Cancun doesn t always stay in Cancun. When Emma Anderson and her friends decided to spend their senior year Spring Break in Cancun, she expected some crazy memories to end their final college days. What Emma didn t expect was to meet Brandon Fisher. Tall and sexy, with dimples that would make any girl swoon, Brandon Fisher was literally the man of Emma s dreams. She couldn't quite believe that this stranger, who seduced her every night in her dreams, actually existed. After serendipitously bumping into each other, Emma could not resist Brandon s pull and spent an unforgettable night with him. Passing it off as a spring break fling, Emma never expected to see Brandon again. But when she started her first day at her new job a few months later, there he was. The only problem was, Brandon didn t even remember her.
