13259270:::::Free Will:::::Belief in free will touches nearly everything that human beings value. It is difficult to think about law, politics, religion, public policy, intimate relationships, morality as well as feelings of remorse or personal achievement without first imagining that every person is the true source of his or her thoughts and actions. And yet the facts tell us that free will is an illusion.
