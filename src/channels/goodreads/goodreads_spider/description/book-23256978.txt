23256978:::::The American Lady:::::Tempestuous and beautiful Wanda Miles, daughter of Ruth and Stephen Miles (or so she thinks), aspires to more than the life of a debutante, but the trouble is she doesn t know precisely what she wants. Then her aunt Marie, the family s renowned glassblower, arrives from Lauscha, Germany, and Wanda decides that learning about her ancestry may hold the key to her future. When Marie accidentally reveals a long-held secret about Wanda s parents, Wanda goes to Lauscha to unravel the truth. While Marie finds herself increasingly swept up in New York City s bohemian social scene catching the eye of a handsome young Italian in the process Wanda explores a past she never knew in the village of her mother s youth and begins to build a life that she never expected. A sweeping tale that takes readers from the small town of Lauscha to the skyscrapers of New York and the sun-kissed coast of Italy, The American Lady is a tribute to the enduring power of family and what we ll do in the name of love.
