We were going to war, and people were going to die. The Vanished are the forgotten: those who live beyond law or society. Mina fought for freedom. She fought for a better life a future. But even a free world can decay. As Mina begins her new life in the Clans she meets people with surprising knowledge about her power, knowledge that could change everything even her relationship with Daniel. But as she makes new friends, old friends turn against her in shocking betrayal. Life in the Compound is tough; there are ways and traditions so strange that Mina begins to suspect foul play at the very heart of her new home.

The Vanished is the second instalment in the Blemished series and follows Mina s story as she continues to challenge those in power and seek out new dangers. With even more rebellion, romance and betrayal, The Vanished promises to take the reader on a roller-coaster ride of adventure and emotion. Will freedom fall?
