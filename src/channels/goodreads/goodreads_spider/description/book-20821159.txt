20821159:::::The Peripheral:::::William Gibson returns with his first novel since 2010 s New York Times bestselling Zero History . Where Flynne and her brother, Burton, live, jobs outside the drug business are rare. Fortunately, Burton has his veteran s benefits, for neural damage he suffered from implants during his time in the USMC s elite Haptic Recon force. Then one night Burton has to go out, but there s a job he s supposed to do a job Flynne didn t know he had. Beta-testing part of a new game, he tells her. The job seems to be simple: work a perimeter around the image of a tower building. Little buglike things turn up. He s supposed to get in their way, edge them back. That s all there is to it. He s offering Flynne a good price to take over for him. What she sees, though, isn t what Burton told her to expect. It might be a game, but it might also be murder.
