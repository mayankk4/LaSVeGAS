6304133:::::Haley Cork and the Blue Door: The Doors of Veselago:::::When a war-ending blast incinerates Haley Cork's father half a world away, she becomes the only one who can get justice for the billions of dead, and must use the powers of the mysterious Blue Door to find and imprison those responsible. Most of the world's fighting men are gone and their widows left behind as prey to corrupt noblemen. The Blue Door called Haley to do more than avenge their deaths -- it selected her to become the latest member of a race of immortals called Keepers. Her dark red hair and amber eyes set her apart from her own community, but the Door intends to take away her humanity as it pursues its own hidden agenda. Every answer leads to more questions: Who detonated the bomb? What exactly is the Blue Door? Why must Haley combat an Enemy who devours entire worlds? Who are these mysterious Keepers? Most girls are ill equipped to investigate the mystery behind the terrible bombing. Not many girls are like Haley Cork, who changes on her path to destiny.
