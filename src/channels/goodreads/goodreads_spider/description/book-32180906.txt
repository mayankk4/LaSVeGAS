32180906:::::The Wanted Virgin:::::Trace Jennings was the brother who most enjoyed his time alone. He never thought about spending the rest of his life with someone, until he found her on his ranch. Addison Becket is on the run. She s finally eighteen and able to break free of her father s control, but taking off on a stormy night landed her in a stranger s bed. Trace is everything Addison dreamed of and more, and neither of them has the urge to let go. Can love at first sight truly exist? And will it be enough to keep them together while others try to tear them apart? Please. This is an Alexa Riley hero. She s not going anywhere. Warning: This short story is filthy good, with co-dependency at its peak! These two people are absolutely crazy, and it if wasn t so sweet, it would be certifiable. Go ahead and suspend your reality while you float away with this cloud of ridiculous!
