Gluttony. Belief. God. Karma. Knowing what you want (there is probably a French word for it). Saying Yes . Destiny. Truth. Devotion. Forgiveness. Life. Happiness (ever after). Hannah and Zoe haven t had much in their lives, but they ve always had each other. So when Zoe tells Hannah she needs to get out of their down-and-out New Jersey town, they pile into Hannah s beat-up old Le Mans and head west, putting everything their deadbeat parents, their disappointing love lives, their inevitable enrollment at community college behind them. As they chase storms and make new friends, Zoe tells Hannah she wants more for her. She wants her to live bigger, dream grander, aim higher. And so Zoe begins teaching Hannah all about life s intangible things, concepts sadly missing from her existence things like audacity , insouciance , karma , and even happiness . An unforgettable read from the acclaimed author of The Probability of Miracles , The Museum of Intangible Things sparkles with the humor and heartbreak of true friendship and first love.
