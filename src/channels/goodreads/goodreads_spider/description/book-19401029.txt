19401029:::::Waterfall:::::Eureka s tears have flooded the earth, and now Atlantis is rising, bringing with it its evil king, Atlas. Eureka is the only one who can stop him, but first she must learn how to fight. She travels across the ocean with Cat, her family, and Ander, the gorgeous and mysterious Seedbearer who promises to help her find Solon, an enigmatic lost Seedbearer who knows how to defeat Atlas. Once on land, Eureka is taunted by gossipwitches, a group of displaced Atlantean sorceresses, and ambushed by locals struggling to survive amid the destruction her tears have wrought.

Her bewildering reflection reveals a soul-crushing secret: if she s strong enough, Eureka can draw on this knowledge to defeat Atlas unless her broken heart is just what he needs to fuel his rising kingdom...
