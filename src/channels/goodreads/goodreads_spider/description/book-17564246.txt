17564246:::::The Back Road:::::One girl is fighting for her life. One village is struggling to hold tight to its secrets. When a young girl is knocked over and left for dead at the side of the road, the small community of Little Melham goes into shock. Why was Abbie out so late at night, and why wasn't she missed? For Ellie Saunders, the truth about that night could put her marriage and even the safety of her children in jeopardy. She has to protect her family, no matter what the consequences.

Only one person knows the whole story - why Abbie was out that night, and who was driving the car. For that person, the accident spells disaster, and somebody has to pay.
