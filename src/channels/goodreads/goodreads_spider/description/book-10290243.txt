10290243:::::Spiders Revenge:::::Old habits die hard. And I plan on mur der ing some one before the night is through. Killing used to be my reg u lar gig, after all. Gin Blanco, aka the Spi der, assassin-for-hire. And I was very good at it. Now, I m ready to make the one hit that truly mat ters: Mab Mon roe, the dan ger ous Fire ele men tal who mur dered my fam ily when I was thir teen. Oh, I don t think the mis sion will be easy, but turns out it s a bit more prob lem atic than expected. The bitch knows I m com ing for her. So now I m up against the army of lethal bounty hunters she hired to track me down. She also put a price on my baby sister s head. Keep ing Bria safe is my first pri or ity. Tak ing Mab out is a close sec ond. Good thing I ve got my pow er ful Stone and Ice magic and my irre sistible lover Owen Grayson to watch my back. This bat tle has been years in the mak ing, and there s a chance I won t sur vive. But if I m going down, then Mab s com ing with me...no mat ter what I have to do to make that happen.
