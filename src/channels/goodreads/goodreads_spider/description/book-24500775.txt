24500775:::::Wild Reckless:::::Kensington Worth had a vision for her senior year. It involved her best friends, her posh private school in downtown Chicago and time alone with her piano until her audition was perfected, a guaranteed ticket into the best music programs in the world. Instead, a nightmare took over. It didn t happen all at once, but her life unraveled quickly a tiny thread that evil somehow kept pulling until everything precious was taken from her. She was suddenly living miles away from her old life, trapped in an existence she didn t choose one determined to destroy her from the inside, leaving only hate and anger behind. It didn t help that her neighbor, the one whose eyes held danger, was enjoying every second of her fall. Owen Harper was trouble, his heart wild and his past the kind that s spoken about in whispers. And somehow, his path was always intertwined with Kensington s, every interaction crushing her, ruining her hope for any future better than her now . Sometimes, though, what everyone warns is trouble, is exactly what the heart needs. Owen Harper was consumed with darkness, and it held onto his soul for years. When Kensington looked at him, she saw a boy who d gotten good at taking others down when they threatened his carefully balanced life. But the more she looked, the more she saw other things too good things things to admire. Things to love. Things that made her want to be reckless. And those things they were the scariest of all.
