5527:::::All the King's Men:::::More than just a classic political novel, Warren s tale of power and corruption in the Depression-era South is a sustained meditation on the unforeseen consequences of every human act, the vexing connectedness of all people and the possibility it s not much of one of goodness in a sinful world. Willie Stark, Warren s lightly disguised version of Huey Long, the onetime Louisiana strongman/governor, begins as a genuine tribune of the people and ends as a murderous populist demagogue. Jack Burden is his press agent, who carries out the boss s orders, first without objection, then in the face of his own increasingly troubled conscience. And the politics? For Warren, that s simply the arena most likely to prove that man is a fallen creature. Which it does.
