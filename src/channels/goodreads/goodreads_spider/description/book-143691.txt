And he's issued Smoky a direct challenge, coaxing her back from the brink with the only thing that could convince her to live.

For as this deranged monster embarks on an unspeakable spree of perversion and murder, Smoky is coming alive again and she's about to face her greatest fears as a cop, a woman, a mother and a merciless killer's next victim.
