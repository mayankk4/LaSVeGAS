16137702:::::Vain:::::If you re looking for a story about a good, humble girl, who s been hurt by someone she thought she could trust, only to find out she s not as vulnerable as she thought she was and discovers an empowering side of herself that falls in love with the guy who helps her find that self, blah, blah, blah...then you re gonna hate my story. Because mine is not the story you read every time you bend back the cover of the latest trend novel. It s not the I can do anything, now that I ve found you/I m misunderstood but one day you ll find me irresistible because of it tale. Why? Because, if I was being honest with you, I m a complete witch. There s nothing redeeming about me. I m a friend using, drug abusing, sex addict from Los Angeles. I m every girlfriend s worst nightmare and every boy s fantasy. I m Sophie Price... And this is the story about how I went from the world s most envied girl to the girl no one wanted around and why I wouldn t trade it for anything in the world.
