8621850:::::The Queen of Water:::::In this poignant novel based on a true story, Virginia's story will speak to anyone who has ever struggled to find his or her place in the world. It will make you laugh and cry, and ultimately, it will fill you with hope. Born in an Andean village in Ecuador, Virginia lives with her large family in a small, earthen-walled dwelling. In her village of ind genas, it is not uncommon to work in the fields all day, even as a child, or to be called a longa tonta - stupid Indian - by members of the ruling class of mestizos, or Spanish descendants. When seven-year-old Virginia is taken from her village to be a servant to a mestizo couple, she has no idea what the future holds. In this poignant novel based on a true story, acclaimed author Laura Resau has collaborated with Mar a Virginia Farinango to recount one girl's unforgettable journey to self-discovery.
