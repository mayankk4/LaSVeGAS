173572:::::Where Is God When It Hurts?:::::If there is a loving God, then why is it that ? You ve heard that question, perhaps asked it yourself. No matter how you complete it, at its root lies the issue of pain. Does God order our suffering? Does he decree an abusive childhood, orchestrate a jet crash, steer a tornado through a community? Or did he simply wind up the world s mainspring and now is watching from a distance? In this Gold Medallion Award winning book, Philip Yancey reveals a God who is neither capricious nor unconcerned. Using examples from the Bible and from his own experiences, Yancey looks at pain physical, emotional, and spiritual and helps us understand why we suffer. Where Is God When It Hurts? will speak to those for whom life sometimes just doesn t make sense. And it will help equip anyone who wants to reach out to someone in pain but just doesn t know what to say.
