18210758:::::Against the Grain: A Coach's Wisdom on Character, Faith, Family, and Love:::::Bill Courtney is a familiar name to those who saw him in Undefeated, the Oscar-winning movie about the high school football team he coached in a downtrodden section of North Memphis. Now, in his first book, Against the Grain Courtney describes the key principles including service, civility, leadership, character, commitment, and forgiveness that have helped young people and adults to live better and more fulfilled lives. Courtney has also passed along these values to his 120 employees at the lumber company he built from scratch. A former drug addict became a line manager and loving family man; an out-of-control cornerback is now a cadet at West Point; a star running back has discovered he can show his emotions and still be strong. Courtney, Esquire magazine s Coach of the Year in 2012, shares these and other compelling stories to illustrate how readers can enrich themselves their families, their businesses, and their communities. Courtney goes against the grain of today s mefirst culture, while explaining why these time-tested principles are needed now more than ever. He shows that winning isn t just about the score at the end of the game, or the profit margin. Ultimately, it s about the impact you make on your fellow human beings and the legacy you leave behind.
