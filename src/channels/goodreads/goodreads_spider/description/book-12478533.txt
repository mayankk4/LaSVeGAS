12478533:::::Bittersweet:::::Once upon a time, Hudson knew exactly what her future looked like. Then a betrayal changed her life, and knocked her dreams to the ground. Now she s a girl who doesn t believe in second chances... a girl who stays under the radar by baking cupcakes at her mom s diner and obsessing over what might have been. So when things start looking up and she has another shot at her dreams, Hudson is equal parts hopeful and terrified. Of course, this is also the moment a cute, sweet guy walks into her life... and starts serving up some seriously mixed signals. She s got a lot on her plate, and for a girl who s been burned before, risking it all is easier said than done.

Because in a place where opportunities are fleeting, she knows this chance may very well be her last...
