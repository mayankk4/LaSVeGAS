17621449:::::Dreamwalker:::::All is quiet at Janet Begay s Crossroads Hotel, where the paranormal is normal, until Emmett Smith, the most powerful mage in the world, arrives to announce his intent to steal Janet s smart-mouthed magic mirror. Janet already has her hands full trying to keep her sister Gabrielle under control as well as plan her upcoming wedding to her dragon-Shifter boyfriend Mick and taking care of the weird creatures that suddenly turn up at Barry s biker bar. When Janet is knocked out fighting the creatures, she wakes up seemingly in the past, when she and Mick had first met and traveled across country by motorcycle, alone and free. The dream seems so real that Janet begins to forget it isn t. The dreams call her back, each one more powerful than the last, until she can no longer distinguish between past and present and she s not the only one affected. Janet and her friends Mick, Cassandra, Nash, Gabrielle, Coyote, and the dragon must band together to thwart this greatest of magics before it splits them into fragments and leaves the world vulnerable to the most evil of evils.
