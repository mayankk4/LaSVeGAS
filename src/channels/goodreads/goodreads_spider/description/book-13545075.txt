13545075:::::UnWholly:::::It s finally here. The long-awaited sequel to the bestselling Unwind , which Publishers Weekly called a gripping, brilliantly imagined futuristic thriller. Thanks to Connor, Lev, and Risa and their high-profile revolt at Happy Jack Harvest Camp people can no longer turn a blind eye to unwinding. Ridding society of troublesome teens while simltaneously providing much-needed tissues for transplant might be convenient, but its morality has finally been brought into question. However, unwinding has become big business, and there are powerful political and corporate interests that want to see it not only continue, but also expand to the unwinding of prisoners and the impoverished. Cam is a product of unwinding; made entirely out of the parts of other unwinds, he is a teen who does not technically exist. A futuristic Frankenstein, Cam struggles with a search for identity and meaning and wonders if a rewound being can have a soul. And when the actions of a sadistic bounty hunter cause Cam s fate to become inextricably bound with the fates of Connor, Risa, and Lev, he ll have to question humanity itself. Rife with action and suspense, this riveting companion to the perennially popular Unwind challenges assumptions about where life begins and ends and what it means to live.
