Hidden in the depths of Cloven Grave, the harsh imposter Harrold King hides a deep secret the parents know nothing about. After spending nine years hidden in a cellar, thirteen year-old Fair O'Nelli finally assumes it's safe to be seen. She knows that her father and brother are missing or possibly dead. But when she sets off in the company of three guardians to find Selador's Gate, she heads right into Harrold King's secret. If she and countless others are to survive, she will have to start making choices that place friendship above fright, faith over doubt, and compassion over fear.
