216196:::::The Burn Journals:::::I don t want to get out of bed. I m so stupid. I did so many things wrong. I don t know what to do. I m going to be in so much trouble. What am I going to do? I m completely screwed. In 1991, fourteen-year-old Brent Runyon came home from school, doused his bathrobe in gasoline, put it on, and lit a match. He suffered third-degree burns over 85% of his body and spent the next year recovering in hospitals and rehab facilities. During that year of physical recovery, Runyon began to question what he d done, undertaking the complicated journey from near-death back to high school, and from suicide back to the emotional mainstream of life. In the tradition of Running with Scissors and Girl, Interrupted , The Burn Journals is a truly remarkable book about teenage despair and recovery.
