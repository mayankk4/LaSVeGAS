History shows the sad consequences as the serpent continues to deceive regarding woman's role and purpose. But as Kris Vallotton explains, that was not God's final answer. The drive to disempower and deface women was the devil's idea--not God's. Through the cross of Christ, the power of the curse in the Garden was broken forever. Taking the reader by the hand for a walk through Scripture, this leader and bestselling author reveals: - God's true plan for women - simple steps for removing the ancient - patterns of enslavement - Jesus's care for women - the true meaning of the apostle Paul's exhortations about women - various examples of women in leadership as God intended In the Garden, the woman was taken out of the man to stand by his side and co-reign with him. Now the world aches for this partnership to be brought into balance once more. This can be achieved, affirms Vallotton, and it begins with understanding God's most beautiful creation.
