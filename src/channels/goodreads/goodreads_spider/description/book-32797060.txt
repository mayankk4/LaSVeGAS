32797060:::::A Thousand Letters:::::Sometimes your life is split by a single decision. I ve spent every day of the last seven years regretting mine: he left, and I didn t follow. A thousand letters went unanswered, my words like petals in the wind, spinning away into nothing, taking me with them. But now he s back. I barely recognize the man he s become, but I can still see a glimmer of the boy who asked me to be his forever, the boy I walked away from when I was young and afraid. Maybe if he d come home under better circumstances, he could speak to me without anger in his voice. Maybe if I d said yes all those years ago, he d look at me without the weight of rejection in his eyes. Maybe if things were different, we would have had a chance. One regretted decision sent him away. One painful journey brought him back to me. I only wish I could keep him. *A contemporary romance inspired by Jane Austen s Persuasion*
