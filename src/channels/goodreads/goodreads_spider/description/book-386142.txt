386142:::::Legally Blonde:::::The hilarious novel that inspired the blockbuster movie-including what's next for Elle Woods! Elle Woods, California University senior, seems to have it all. President of Delta Gamma sorority, she's aced her major--sociopolitical jewellery design-and is on the verge of becoming Mrs. Warner Huntington III. Too bad Warner, bound for Stanford Law, dumps her with the explanation that he now needs a more "serious" woman at his side. Faced with this unexpected reversal of fortune, Woods doesn't get depressed, she gets busy. Thanks to a creative application video and a demand for "diversity" at Stanford Law, Elle is admitted. Soon she's packing up her convertible-as well as her pet Chihuahua "Underdog"-and heading north, determined to win back her man. Smart, fast and funny, Legally Blonde proves just how much fun blondes really can have.
