316943:::::Selected Poems:::::John F. Kennedy said of Robert Frost: "He has bequeathed his nation a body of imperishable verse from which Americans will forever gain joy and understanding." A four-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for poetry, Frost created a new poetic language that has a deep and timeless resonance. In addition to Robert Frost's first three books, this collection includes eighteen early poems that did not appear in his eleven books of poetry and have rarely been reprinted. Some of these express the idealism of youth inspired by heroic figures of the past. Others are love poems to Elinor White, whom he married in 1895. This book features a deluxe cover, ribbon marker, top stain, and decorative endpapers with a nameplate.
