Wood in Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, edited by Paul Guyer and Allen W. Wood (Cambridge University Press, 1997). In the current Easter book fair there will appear a book of mine, entitled Critique of Pure Reason [...] This book contains the result of all the varied investigations that start from the concepts we debated together under the heading mundi sensibilis and mundi intelligibilis. thus begins Kant s letter to Marcus Herz from 1 May 1781 (Ak. 10:266). Kant s own copy of this book was housed at the Staats- und Universit tsbibliothek K nigsberg, before being lost in 1945. Fortunately Kant s marginalia had already been printed at Ak. 23:17-50, as well as in Erdmann [1881]; they are also included in the Guyer/Wood translation.
