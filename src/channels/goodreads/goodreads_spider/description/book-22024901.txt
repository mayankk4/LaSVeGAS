22024901:::::Fuel the Fire:::::Protect your family. At all costs. It d take the impossible to hurt Connor Cobalt, even for a moment. Protect your family. At all costs. At twenty-six, his narcissistic tendencies have made room for the people he loves. Protect your family. At all costs. And he loves Rose. But when his love is threatened, when his greatest dreams with her are compromised what is the cost then? Protect your family. At all costs. Love will guide his choices. For the first time in his life. ***Authors' Note*** It's possible to only read the Calloway Sisters spin-off series without reading the Addicted series, but you MUST read Hothouse Flower (Calloway Sisters #2) before reading Fuel the Fire (Calloway Sisters #3). It's highly recommended to read the books in the recommended reading order, which is in tangent with the Addicted series. If you choose not to read Addicted After All before Fuel the Fire, there will be a time jump. Fuel the Fire picks up in the Addicted Timeline where Addicted After All ended. FTF will not retell past events from Addicted After All in Rose &amp; Connor's POV. All new material.
