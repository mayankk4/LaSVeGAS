93575:::::Gaudy Night:::::Gaudy Night stands out even among Miss Sayers s novels. And Miss Sayers has long stood in a class by herself. Times Literary Supplement The great Dorothy L. Sayers is considered by many to be the premier detective novelist of the Golden Age, and her dashing sleuth, Lord Peter Wimsey, one of mystery fiction s most enduring and endearing protagonists. Acclaimed author Ruth Rendell has expressed her admiration for Sayers s work, praising her great fertility of invention, ingenuity, and wonderful eye for detail. The third Dorothy L. Sayers classic to feature mystery writer Harriet Vane, Gaudy Night is now back in print with an introduction by Elizabeth George, herself a crime fiction master. Gaudy Night takes Harriet and her paramour, Lord Peter, to Oxford University, Harriet s alma mater, for a reunion, only to find themselves the targets of a nightmare of harassment and mysterious, murderous threats.
