25785993:::::Giant Days, Vol. 1:::::Susan, Esther, and Daisy started at university three weeks ago and became fast friends. Now, away from home for the first time, all three want to reinvent themselves. But in the face of handwringing boys, personal experimentation, influenza, mystery-mold, nu-chauvinism, and the willful, unwanted intrusion of academia, they may be lucky just to make it to spring alive. Going off to university is always a time of change and growth, but for Esther, Susan, and Daisy, things are about to get a little weird. Collects issues #1-4.
