301022:::::The Boyfriend List: 15 Guys, 11 Shrink Appointments, 4 Ceramic Frogs and Me, Ruby Oliver:::::Ruby Oliver is 15 and has a shrink. She knows it s unusual, but give her a break she s had a rough 10 days. In the past 10 days she: lost her boyfriend (#13 on the list), lost her best friend (Kim), lost all her other friends (Nora, Cricket), did something suspicious with a boy (#10), did something advanced with a boy (#15), had an argument with a boy (#14), drank her first beer (someone handed it to her), got caught by her mom (ag!), had a panic attack (scary), lost a lacrosse game (she s the goalie), failed a math test (she ll make it up), hurt Meghan s feelings (even though they aren t really friends), became a social outcast (no one to sit with at lunch) and had graffiti written about her in the girls bathroom (who knows what was in the boys !?!). But don t worry Ruby lives to tell the tale. And make more lists.
