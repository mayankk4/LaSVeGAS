17607319:::::Stealing Harper:::::This is Chase's POV from Taking Chances. Chase Grayson has never been interested in having a relationship that lasts longer than it takes for him and his date to get dressed again. But then he stumbles into a gray-eyed girl whose innocence pours off her, and everything changes. From the minute Harper opens her mouth to let him know just how much he disgusts her, he's hooked. But a princess deserves a Prince Charming who can make her dreams come true. Not a guy who can turn her life into a nightmare. All good intentions go out the window when Harper starts to fall for the guy Chase has come to view as a brother. He wanted to protect her by keeping her away, but he can't stand to see her with anyone else, and he'll do anything to make her his. But when it comes down to Harper choosing between the two, will Chase have the strength to step back from the girl who has become his whole world if it means she's happy? Lines will be crossed. Friendships will be put to the test. And hearts will be shattered. CAUTION: DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT READ TAKING CHANCES
