7844667:::::Only the Strong Survive : A Son Fighting for His Life:::::The Serenity Prayer By Reinhold Niebuhr God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change Courage to change the things I can and wisdom to know the difference Living one day at a time Enjoying one moment at a time Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace. Taking, as He did, this sinful world as it is, not as I would have it Trusting that He will make all things right if I surrender to His Will That I may be reasonably happy in this life and supremely happy with Him forever in the next. Amen.
