33163378:::::Moxie:::::Moxie girls fight back! Vivian Carter is fed up. Fed up with her small-town Texas high school that thinks the football team can do no wrong. Fed up with sexist dress codes and hallway harassment. But most of all, Viv Carter is fed up with always following the rules. Viv s mom was a punk rock Riot Grrrl in the 90s, so now Viv takes a page from her mother s past and creates a feminist zine that she distributes anonymously to her classmates. She s just blowing off steam, but other girls respond. Pretty soon Viv is forging friendships with other young women across the divides of cliques and popularity rankings, and she realizes that what she has started is nothing short of a girl revolution.
