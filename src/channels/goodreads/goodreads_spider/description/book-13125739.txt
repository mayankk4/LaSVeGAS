13125739:::::Full House:::::Rosie loves her children very much, but now they are all grown up, isn't it time they left home? Rosie moved out when she got married, but it didn't work out, so now she is back with her parents. Helen is a teacher and doesn't earn enough for a place of her own. Anthony writes songs and is just waiting for the day when someone will pay him for them. Until then, all three are happy at home. It doesn't cost them anything, and surely their parents like having a full house? Then there is a crisis, and Dee decides things have to change for the whole family... whether they like it or not.
