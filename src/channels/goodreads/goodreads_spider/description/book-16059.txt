16059:::::The Dive From Clausen's Pier:::::Carrie Bell was born and raised in Wisconsin. She's had the same best friend, the same good relationship with her mother, and the same boyfriend for as long as anyone can remember. She is already quietly bored with Mike when he is horrifically injured in a diving accident at Clausen's Reservoir. Now the future that Carrie was only beginning to rebel against looks set in stone.

It is a moment of terrifying confusion, but also of mesmerizing possibility.
