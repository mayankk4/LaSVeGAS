91953:::::Leviathan:::::According to Hobbes self interest is the first principle of human conduct. Hobbes view this behavior as the base element of social confrontation. I very much agree with Hobbes point of view as far as self interest of the individual is concern, i also agree with his view of human life as as being short, hash and brutish. His view on human nature is problematic to say the least and i disagree with his proposition that only a strong monarch (leader) is the only prescription to avoid social chaos.
