8601702:::::Fables, Vol. 15: Rose Red:::::Winner of Fourteen Eisner Awards Every Rose has its thorn. As the Fables of the mundane world try desperately to shield themselves from the withering power of Mister Dark, Rose Red - the Farm's ostensible leader - is finally jolted out of her crippling depression and into action by a timely revelation from her storybook past. Her epiphany comes not a moment too soon - as more and more of New York City falls under Mister Dark's malign power, the chances of striking a decisive blow against him are getting smaller by the hour. Luckily, the survivors of Fabletown have the world's most powerful witch on their side - and she well may be the only entity more ruthless than the Dark Man himself. Including the special oversized 100th issue of writer Bill Willingham's acclaimed creation. Collecting : Fables 94-100
