17906245:::::Hyperbole and a Half:::::Every time Allie Brosh posts something new on her hugely popular blog Hyperbole and a Half the internet rejoices. Touching, absurd, and darkly comic, Allie Brosh s highly anticipated book Hyperbole and a Half showcases her unique voice, leaping wit, and her ability to capture complex emotions with deceptively simple illustrations. This full-color, beautifully illustrated edition features more than fifty percent new content, with ten never-before-seen essays and one wholly revised and expanded piece as well as classics from the website like, The God of Cake, Dogs Don t Understand Basic Concepts Like Moving, and her astonishing, Adventures in Depression, and Depression Part Two, which have been hailed as some of the most insightful meditations on the disease ever written. Brosh s debut marks the launch of a major new American humorist who will surely make even the biggest scrooge or snob laugh. We dare you not to.
