125984:::::My Secret Book:::::Written by one of the greatest poets of all time, My Secret Book, now in its first English translation, is a profound and deeply personal account of inner suffering and mental anguish. Deeply troubled by his struggle and failure to achieve spiritual perfection, Petrarch, considered the forefather of Italian humanism, sought catharsis in the writing of a secret book. Only here could he pour out his innermost thoughts, frustrations, and desires. Written in the form of a dialogue between himself and St. Augustine, the book wrestles with the universal themes of suffering, desire, fear, and joy. The result is a rare insight into Petrarch s life and thought and a remarkable early example of self-revelation and autobiography.
