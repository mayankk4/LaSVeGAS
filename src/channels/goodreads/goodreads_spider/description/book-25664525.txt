25664525:::::Romancing the Nerd:::::Cool guy. Geeky girl. Let the games begin. Dan Garrett has become exactly what he hates popular. Until recently, he was just another live-action role-playing nerd on the lowest rung of the social ladder. Cue a massive growth spurt and an uncanny skill at taking three-point shots in basketball and voila Mr. Popular. It s definitely weird. And the biggest drawback? Going from high school zero to basketball hero cost Dan the secret girl of his dorky dreams. A tuba-playing nerd with an eclectic fashion sense, Zelda Potts s coolness stat is about minus forty-two. Dan turning his back on her and the rest of nerd-dom was brutal enough, but when he humiliates her at school, Zelda decides it s time for a little revenge dork style. Nevermind that she used to have a crush on him. Nevermind that her plan could backfire big time. It s time to roll the dice and hope like freakin hell she doesn t lose her heart in the process.
