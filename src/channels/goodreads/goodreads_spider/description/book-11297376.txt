11297376:::::Dirty Blood:::::I killed a girl last night. I did it with my bare hands and an old piece of pipe I found lying next to the dumpster. But that s not the part that got me. The part that scared me, the part I can t seem to wrap my head around and still has me reeling, was that when she charged me, her body shifted and then she was a wolf. All snapping teeth and extended claws. But by the time I stood over her lifeless body, she was a girl again. That s about the time I went into shock And that was the moment he showed up. Now, all I can do is accept the truths that are staring me in the face. One, Werewolves do exist. And Two, I was born to kill them.
