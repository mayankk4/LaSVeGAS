23254701:::::Torture to Her Soul:::::Don't say it unless you mean it It's a simple concept, one I've said time and again, but something people don't seem to comprehend. You should choose every syllable carefully, because you never know when somebody will hold you to your word. Somebody like me. I'm not a good man. I'm not. I know. I have enough darkness inside of me to rid the world of every stitch of light. But there's one I could never harm, one light I couldn't bring myself to snuff out. Karissa. She thinks I'm a monster, and maybe I am. I taunt her with my touch, get a thrill out of torturing her soul. But I'm not the only one. The world is full of monsters, and I'm not the most dangerous one out there. Not even close God help me, I love her. I do. And God help anybody who tries to take her from me. AUTHOR'S NOTE: This book is intended for a mature audience only, due to some dark and erotic content.
