112204:::::The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson:::::THE ONLY ONE-VOLUME EDITION CONTAINING ALL 1,775 OF EMILY DICKINSON S POEMS Only eleven of Emily Dickinson s poems were published prior to her death in 1886; the startling originality of her work doomed it to obscurity in her lifetime. Early posthumously published collections-some of them featuring liberally edited versions of the poems-did not fully and accurately represent Dickinson s bold experiments in prosody, her tragic vision, and the range of her intellectual and emotional explorations. Not until the 1955 publication of The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson , a three-volume critical edition compiled by Thomas H. Johnson, were readers able for the first time to assess, understand, and appreciate the whole of Dickinson s extraordinary poetic genius. This book, a distillation of the three-volume Complete Poems , brings together the original texts of all 1,775 poems that Emily Dickinson wrote.
