13854:::::Promise of the Witch King:::::The book was hidden well. It's pages promised the power of the Witch-King himself. And now that it's been found, even the fact that it kills anyone foolish enough to crack its cover won't stop people from fighting over it. Welcome to the Bloodstone Lands! Human assassin Artemis Entreri and his dark elf companion Jarlaxle have come to the demon-haunted wastelands of the frozen north at the request of their dragon patron. It doesn't take long for them to find themselves caught in the middle of a struggle between powerful forces that would like nothing more than to see them both dead -- or worse. But Entreri and Jarlaxle aren't just any wandering sellswords, and the ancient evils and bitter blood-feuds of the wild Bloodstone Lands may have finally met their match.
