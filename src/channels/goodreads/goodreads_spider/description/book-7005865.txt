7005865:::::The Atlantis Complex:::::ARTEMIS FOWL HAS LOST HIS MIND JUST WHEN THE WORLD NEEDS HIM MOST Artemis has committed his entire fortune to a project he believes will save the planet and its inhabitants, both human and fairy. Can it be true? Has goodness taken hold of the world s greatest teenage criminal mastermind? Captain Holly Short is unconvinced, and discovers that Artemis is suffering from Atlantis Complex, a psychosis common among guilt-ridden fairies not humans and most likely triggered by Artemis s dabbling with fairy magic. Symptoms include obsessive-compulsive behavior, paranoia, multiple personality disorder and, in extreme cases, embarrassing professions of love to a certain feisty LEPrecon fairy. Unfortunately, Atlantis Complex has struck at the worst possible time. A deadly foe from Holly s past is intent on destroying the actual city of Atlantis. Can Artemis escape the confines of his mind and the grips of a giant squid in time to save the underwater metropolis and its fairy inhabitants? New York Times best-selling author Eoin Colfer delivers a knockout, fast-paced, and hilarious adventure in Artemis Fowl: The Atlantis Complex , the seventh book in the blockbuster series.
