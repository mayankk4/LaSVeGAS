When the Indigo Kingdom conquered her homeland, Wilhelmina and other orphaned children of nobility were taken to Skyvale, the Indigo Kingdom s capital.

With Osprey missions becoming increasingly dangerous and their leader more unstable, Wil can t trust anyone. She is a threat. Wraith is the toxic by-product of magic, and for a century using magic has been forbidden. Still the wraith pours across the continent, reshaping the land and animals into fresh horrors. Soon it will reach the Indigo Kingdom. Wilhelmina s magic might be the key to stopping the wraith, but if the vigilante Black Knife discovers Wil s magic, she will vanish like all the others.
