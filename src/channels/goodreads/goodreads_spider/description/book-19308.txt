19308:::::Pippi Goes on Board:::::Outrageous Pippi Longstocking of Villa Villekulla has no parents around and no rules to follow, so she lives according to her own daredevilish ways. She has been treating her friends Tommy and Annika to wild adventures, too - like buying, and eating, seventy-two pounds of candy on a shopping trip, or sailing off to an island in the middle of a lake to show them what it's like to be shipwrecked. But then Pippi's long lost father returns, and she might have to leave Villa Villekulla!
