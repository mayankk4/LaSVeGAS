5231173:::::Twenty Boy Summer:::::"Don t worry, Anna. I ll tell her, okay? Just let me think about the best way to do it." "Okay." "Promise me? Promise you won t say anything?" "Don t worry. I laughed. It s our secret, right?" According to Anna s best friend, Frankie, twenty days in Zanzibar Bay is the perfect opportunity to have a summer fling, and if they meet one boy every day, there s a pretty good chance Anna will find her first summer romance. Anna lightheartedly agrees to the game, but there s something she hasn t told Frankie she s already had her romance, and it was with Frankie s older brother, Matt, just before his tragic death one year ago. TWENTY BOY SUMMER explores what it truly means to love someone, what it means to grieve, and ultimately, how to make the most of every beautiful moment life has to offer.
