28959148:::::We're All Damaged:::::Andy Carter was happy. He had a solid job. He ran 5Ks for charity. He was living a nice, safe Midwestern existence. And then his wife left him for a handsome paramedic down the street. We re All Damaged begins after Andy has lost his job, ruined his best friend s wedding, and moved to New York City, where he lives in a tiny apartment with an angry cat named Jeter that isn t technically his. But before long he needs to go back to Omaha to say good-bye to his dying grandfather. Back home, Andy is confronted with his past, which includes his ex, his ex s new boyfriend, his right-wing talk-radio-host mother, his parents crumbling marriage, and his still-angry best friend. As if these old problems weren t enough, Andy encounters an entirely new complication: Daisy. She has fifteen tattoos, no job, and her own difficult past. But she claims she is the only person who can help Andy be happy again, if only she weren t hiding a huge secret that will mess things up even more. Andy Carter needs a second chance at life, and Daisy and the person Daisy pushes Andy to become may be his last chance to set things right.
