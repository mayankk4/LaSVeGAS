16158611:::::Avenging Angel:::::Earthly Delights With a messed up family background and a tendency to grow claws and fangs, Tanner Chance isn t exactly the boy next door. But he s a decent cop, and he keeps himself on the side of the good guys. Convenient, because when he rescues a survivor of a horrific shifter attack he finds himself instantly smitten with an honest-to-goodness angel, as innocent as she is irresistible. Marna may be angelic, but she s not stupid or weak. She can take care of herself. Tanner is more temptation than protection anyway. Or so she thinks, until someone wearing her face starts taking out some of New Orleans more unsavory paranormals. With police and predators both gunning for her blood, Marna has no choice but to trust Tanner even though what s sparking between them is hotter than anything holy.
