4583489:::::Death's Daughter:::::DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL For the last few years I'd been in a state of bliss--living under a self-imposed Forgetting Charm, because I so did not want to go into the family business. What I wanted was a glamorous career in New York City and the opportunity for a normal life--buying designer shoes on sale, dating guys from craigslist, Web surfing for organic dim sum for my boss. And then my father's Executive Assistant, a faun named Jarvis, showed up to tell me that my dad has been kidnapped. Good-bye Forgetting Charm. Hell, (unwanted) responsibility. Not only am I expected to step into the CEO slot on the company Board, but I have to "prove my worth" by competing against the Devil's prot g --who so hot in more ways than one. The contest involves finding three (why is it always three?) objects of power. In Hell. One of them is this adorable puppy--who happens to be a hellhound. The others are turning out to be not much fun . All this so I can take (unwanted) charge of Death, Inc. My name is Calliope Reaper-Jones, and I'm... Death's Daughter .
