91571:::::Measure for Measure:::::Measure for Measure is among the most passionately discussed of Shakespeare s plays. In it, a duke temporarily removes himself from governing his city-state, deputizing a member of his administration, Angelo, to enforce the laws more rigorously. Angelo chooses as his first victim Claudio, condemning him to death because he impregnated Juliet before their marriage. Claudio s sister Isabella, who is entering a convent, pleads for her brother s life. Angelo attempts to extort sex from her, but Isabella preserves her chastity. The duke, in disguise, eavesdrops as she tells her brother about Angelo s behavior, then offers to ally himself with her against Angelo.
