42389:::::Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest:::::As good a rifle company as any, Easy Company, 506th Airborne Division, US Army, kept getting tough assignments--responsible for everything from parachuting into France early DDay morning to the capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest at Berchtesgaden. In "Band of Brothers," Ambrose tells of the men in this brave unit who fought, went hungry, froze &amp; died, a company that took 150% casualties &amp; considered the Purple Heart a badge of office. Drawing on hours of interviews with survivors as well as the soldiers' journals &amp; letters, Stephen Ambrose recounts the stories, often in the men's own words, of these American heroes.
