3798703:::::The Spectacular Now:::::This National Book Award Finalist is now a major motion picture -- one of the most buzzed-about films at Sundance 2013, starring Shailene Woodley and Miles Teller. SUTTER KEELY. HE S the guy you want at your party. He ll get everyone dancing. He ll get everyone in your parents pool. Okay, so he s not exactly a shining academic star. He has no plans for college and will probably end up folding men s shirts for a living. But there are plenty of ladies in town, and with the help of Dean Martin and Seagram s V.O., life s pretty fabuloso, actually. Until the morning he wakes up on a random front lawn, and he meets Aimee. Aimee s clueless. Aimee is a social disaster. Aimee needs help, and it s up to the Sutterman to show Aimee a splendiferous time and then let her go forth and prosper. But Aimee s not like other girls, and before long he s in way over his head. For the first time in his life, he has the power to make a difference in someone else s life or ruin it forever.
