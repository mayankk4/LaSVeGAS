13146214:::::Because of Low:::::In my debut novel, Breathe, Sadie may have fallen in love with the teen rock star, Jax Stone, but readers fell head over heels for Marcus Hardy. This is his story Marcus Hardy had hoped to enjoy a year away at college while he put the summer he d rather forget behind him. But instead, he s jerked right back to the coastal town of Sea Breeze, Alabama due to a family crisis. His dear ol' dad found himself a girlfriend only a few years older than Marcus. So now his sister needs help dealing with their mother who is mentally falling apart. The only bright spot to returning is the fascinating red head who sleeps over several times a week. The problem is she's sleeping in bed with his new roommate, Cage York. Willow Low Foster needs a place to live. Running to Cage s apartment every time her sister kicks her out isn t exactly a long term solution. Juggling her courses at the local community college and a part time job doesn t produce excess income. But Cage has a new roommate and suddenly sleeping over at her best friend s apartment isn t such a bad thing. Not when she gets to see those sexy green eyes of Marcus Hardy s twinkle when he smiles at her like he wants her there. Even though Cage seems a little territorial where Low is concerned, Marcus finds time to spend with Low without upsetting his roommate. Cage may use his small college baseball star persona to sleep with every hot female in his path but he s still under the disillusion that when he s through sowing his wild oats, he s going to marry Low. Marcus intends to change that assumption for both Cage and Low. Until his carefully laid plans come crashing down with a revelation he never expected. He ll have to choose between Low or his family. Because once the truth comes out.... there s no other choice.
