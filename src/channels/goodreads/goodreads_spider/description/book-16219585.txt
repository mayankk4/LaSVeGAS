16219585:::::Waffles and Pancakes:::::Waffles and Pancakes are two hamsters who were bought from the pet store on the very same day. But their owners, Danny and Griffin, don't treat them the same way. Pancakes has a lovely new home to play around in with wheels and tunnels. Waffles only has a small box.
