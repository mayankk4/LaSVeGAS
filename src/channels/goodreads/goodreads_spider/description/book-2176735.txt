2176735:::::Breath:::::Tim Winton is Australia s best-loved novelist. His new work, Breath, is an extraordinary evocation of an adolescence spent resisting complacency, testing one s limits against nature, finding like-minded souls, and discovering just how far one breath will take you. It s a story of extremes extreme sports and extreme emotions. On the wild, lonely coast of Western Australia, two thrillseeking and barely adolescent boys fall into the enigmatic thrall of veteran big-wave surfer Sando. Together they form an odd but elite trio. The grown man initiates the boys into a kind of Spartan ethos, a regimen of risk and challenge, where they test themselves in storm swells on remote and shark-infested reefs, pushing each other to the edges of endurance, courage, and sanity. But where is all this heading? Why is their mentor s past such forbidden territory? And what can explain his American wife s peculiar behavior? Venturing beyond all limits in relationships, in physical challenge, and in sexual behavior there is a point where oblivion is the only outcome. Full of Winton s lyrical genius for conveying physical sensation, Breath is a rich and atmospheric coming-of-age tale from one of world literature s finest storytellers.
