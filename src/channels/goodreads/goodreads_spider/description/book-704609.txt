704609:::::The Bar Code Rebellion:::::They want your identity. They want your freedom. They can't have them. The bar code rebellion. Kayla has resisted getting the bar code tattoo, even though it's meant forfeiting a "normal" life. Without the tattoo, she's an exile. But she can't stay an exile for long.... For reasons she doesn't completely understand--but will soon discover--Kayla is at the center of a lethan conspiracy that will soon threaten the very notion of freedom. Kayla can either give in to the bar code, or she can join the resistance and fight it. The choice, to her, is clear: It's time to fight. They want your identity. They want your freedom. They can't have them. The bar code rebellion.
