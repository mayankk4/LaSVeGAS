17729712:::::Beautiful Broken Rules:::::The most valuable lesson Emerson Moore ever learned was from her parents: never get too attached to someone else. That s why this hard-partying college student plays by her own code of bedroom conduct, refusing to stay with the same guy for too long. She gets all the pleasure of having a good time without the messiness of a relationship. So what if frat house-hopping has earned her a certain reputation around campus? At least no one gets hurt this way especially her. When ridiculously gorgeous Jaxon Riley moves in next door, Emerson s not sure how long her vow against emotional intimacy can last. Jaxon s tattoo, muscles, and sexy voice make him tempting, but he also seems to really understand her until his jealous ex-girlfriend and Emerson s life-changing discovery about her parents get thrown into the mix. After everything she s been through, can Emerson handle a real relationship? Or will breaking her rules just lead to a broken heart? New Adult/Adult Contemporary Romance - recommended for ages 18 and up.
