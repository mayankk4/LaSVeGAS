In the thrilling third installment of Anna Godbersen s bestselling Luxe series, Manhattan s most envied residents appear to have everything they desire: Wealth. Beauty. Happiness. But sometimes the most practiced smiles hide the most scandalous secrets. Jealous whispers. Old rivalries. New betrayals. This is Manhattan, 1899. Two months after Elizabeth Holland s dramatic homecoming, Manhattan eagerly awaits her return to the pinnacle of society. When Elizabeth refuses to rejoin her sister Diana s side, however, those watching New York s favorite family begin to suspect that all is not as it seems behind the stately doors of No. 17 Gramercy Park South. Farther uptown, Henry and Penelope Schoonmaker are the city s most celebrated couple. But despite the glittering diamond ring on Penelope s finger, the newlyweds share little more than scorn for each other. And while the newspapers call Penelope s social-climbing best friend, Carolina Broad, an heiress, her fortune and her fame is anything but secure. Mystery, romance, jealousy, betrayal, humor, and gorgeous, historically accurate details. I couldn t put The Luxe down!
