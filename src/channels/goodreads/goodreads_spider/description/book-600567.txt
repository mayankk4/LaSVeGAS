600567:::::Once Upon Stilettos:::::Click your heels three times and say, There s no place like Bloomies! Katie Chandler s life is pure magic literally. As an executive assistant at Magic, Spells, and Illusions, Inc., she s seen more than her share of fantastical occurrences. A mere Manhattan mortal, Katie is no wizard, but she s a wiz at exposing hokum pocus, cloaked lies, and deceptive enchantments. And she s fallen under the all-too-human spell of attraction to Owen, a hunky wizard and coworker. Owen, however, is preoccupied. Someone has broken into his office and disrupted top-secret files, and it reeks of an inside job. CEO Merlin (yes, the Merlin) taps Katie and her special ability to uncover the magical mole. Keeping her feelings in check while sleuthing alongside Owen, Katie is shocked to discover that her immunity to magic is waning, putting her in grave danger. Soon she s surrendering to the charms and enchantments of everyone and everything around her, including a killer pair of red stilettos. Katie must now conjure up her natural instincts to get to the bottom of the break-in, regain her power, and win the wizard of her dreams.
