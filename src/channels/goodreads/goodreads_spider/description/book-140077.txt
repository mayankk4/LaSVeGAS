140077:::::Dead to the World:::::Sookie Stackhouse is a cocktail waitress in Bon Temps, Louisiana. She has only a few close friends, because not everyone appreciates Sookie s gift: she can read minds. That s not exactly every man s idea of date bait unless they re undead; vampires and the like can be tough to read. And that s just the kind of guy Sookie s been looking for. Maybe that s why, when she comes across a naked vampire, she doesn t just drive on by. He hasn t got a clue who he is, but Sookie has: Eric looks just as scary and sexy and dead as ever. But now he has amnesia, he s sweet, vulnerable, and in need of Sookie s help because whoever took his memory now wants his life.
