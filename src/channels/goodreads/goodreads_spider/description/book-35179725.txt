35179725:::::The Queen & the Homo Jock King:::::Do you believe in love at first sight? Sanford Stewart sure doesn't. In fact, he pretty much believes in the exact opposite, thanks to the Homo Jock King. It seems Darren Mayne lives for nothing more than to create chaos in Sandy s perfectly ordered life, just for the hell of it. Sandy despises him, and nothing will ever change his mind. Or so he tells himself. It's not until the owner of Jack It the club where Sandy performs as drag queen Helena Handbasket comes to him with a desperate proposition that Sandy realizes he might have to put his feelings about Darren aside. Because Jack It will close unless someone can convince Andrew Taylor, the mayor of Tucson, to keep it open. Someone like Darren, the mayor s illegitimate son. The foolproof plan is this: seduce Darren and push him to convince his father to renew Jack It s contract with the city. Simple, right? Wrong.
