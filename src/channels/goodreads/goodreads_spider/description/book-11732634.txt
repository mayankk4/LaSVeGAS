11732634:::::Smokin' Seventeen:::::Where there s smoke there s fire, and no one knows this better than New Jersey bounty hunter Stephanie Plum. Dead bodies are showing up in shallow graves on the empty construction lot of Vincent Plum Bail Bonds. No one is sure who the killer is, or why the victims have been offed, but what is clear is that Stephanie s name is on the killer s list. Short on time to find the murderer, Stephanie is also under pressure from family and friends to choose between her on-again-off-again boyfriend, Trenton cop Joe Morelli, and the bad boy in her life, security expert Ranger. Stephanie s mom wants her to dump them both for a former high school football star who s just returned to town. Stephanie s sidekick, Lula, suggests a red-hot boudoir bake-off. And Joe s old-world grandmother gives Stephanie the eye, which may mean that it s time to get out of town. With a cold-blooded killer after her, a handful of hot men, and a capture list that includes a dancing bear and a senior citizen vampire, Stephanie s life looks like it s about to go up in smoke.
