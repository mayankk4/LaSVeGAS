6460146:::::Itazura Na Kiss, Volume 1:::::High school senior Kotoko Aihara has had a crush on Naoki Irie since his freshman year. Unfortunately, a few things are discouraging her from him: he's a member of "Class A," the top ranking class in school, whereas she's in "Class F"; he gets the top score on every exam; and he's so smart, popular, and handsome that he's been class president every year. When Kotoki finally musters up the courage to present him with a love letter, though, Naoki outright refuses it, telling her point blank - with a look of disgust and boredom - that he doesn't like "stupid girls." Poor Kotoko's worst nightmare
