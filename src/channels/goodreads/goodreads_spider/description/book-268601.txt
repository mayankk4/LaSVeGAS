268601:::::Glory in Death:::::It is 2058, New York City. In a world where technology can reveal the darkest of secrets, there's only one place to hide a crime of passion-in the heart.

And their intimate relations with men of great power and wealth provide Eve with a long list of suspects -- including her own lover, Roarke.
