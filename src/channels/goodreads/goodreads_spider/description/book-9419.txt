9419:::::Shopaholic Ties the Knot:::::Life has been good for Becky Bloomwood: She s become the best personal shopper at Barneys, she and her successful entrepreneurial boyfriend, Luke, are living happily in Manhattan s West Village, and her new next-door neighbor is a fashion designer! But with her best friend, Suze, engaged, how can Becky fail to notice that her own ring finger is bare? Not that she s been thinking of marriage (or diamonds) or anything . . . Then Luke proposes! Bridal registries dance in Becky s head. Problem is, two other people are planning her wedding: Becky s overjoyed mother has been waiting forever to host a backyard wedding, with the bride resplendent in Mum s frilly old gown. While Luke s high-society mother is insisting on a glamorous, all-expenses-paid affair at the Plaza. Both weddings for the same day. And Becky can t seem to turn down either one. Can everyone s favorite shopaholic tie the knot before everything unravels?
