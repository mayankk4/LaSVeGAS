But he may never get what he wants, thanks to the fuk the ancient curse that has haunted Oscar's family for generations, dooming them to prison, torture, tragic accidents, and, above all, ill-starred love. Oscar, still dreaming of his first kiss, is only its most recent victim until the fateful summer that he decides to be its last.
