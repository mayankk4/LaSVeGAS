18481904:::::Truly:::::May Fredericks hates New York. Which is fair enough, since New York seems to hate her back. Just weeks after moving from Wisconsin to Manhattan, she receives the world's worst marriage proposal, stabs her boyfriend with a shrimp fork in a very public venue, and accidentally becomes notorious. And that s before she gets mugged. At her wit's end, May washes up at a Packers bar in Greenwich Village, where she meets a surly, unhelpful guy who hates her shoes and calls her ex a douche. His name is Ben. He used to be a chef. Now he's a rooftop beekeeper with anger management issues. She wouldn't even like him, but he reminds her of home and he knows where to find all the best food in the Village. She makes him laugh. He buys her tacos and cowboy boots. The longer they re stuck together, the better May and Ben get along and the harder they fall. TRULY is a quirky, modern New York love story unlike any you've read before. ********* About the Serialization TRULY, the first novel in Ruthie Knox s forthcoming New York Series, will be serialized in its entirety on Wattpad.
