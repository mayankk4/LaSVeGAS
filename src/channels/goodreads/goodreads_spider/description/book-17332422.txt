17332422:::::Sleeping Beauty's Daughters:::::The classic fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty is transformed by Diane Zahler, the acclaimed author of The Thirteenth Princess , into a dazzling new story of two sisters fighting a powerful curse. Briskly paced and full of lush descriptions, readers who enjoy the work of Shannon Hale and Gail Carson Levine will be swept away by this spellbinding novel. The daughters of Sleeping Beauty, Princesses Aurora and Luna, have grown up in a cliff-top palace by the sea, where they are carefully protected by their parents. No one visits, the girls cannot stray beyond the castle walls, and all sharp objects are forbidden here. But accidents will happen particularly when an old curse still has power. Soon, in spite of all precautions, Aurora is struggling not to slip into an enchanted sleep. Frantic, the princesses accept the help of a young fisherman named Symon and embark on a daring ocean voyage to find their aunt a fairy who may be able to break the spell. From fearsome beasts to raging storms, many dangers befall them, yet they must not give up . . . for if Aurora sleeps, she will not wake for one hundred years.
