776159:::::The Lady in the Lake:::::A couple of missing wives one a rich man's and one a poor man's become the objects of Marlowe's investigation. One of them may have gotten a Mexican divorce and married a gigolo and the other may be dead. Marlowe's not sure he cares about either one, but he's not paid to care.
