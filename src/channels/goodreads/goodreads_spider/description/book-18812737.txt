18812737:::::With You:::::Sculpt is an illegal fighter. He s also the lead singer of a local rock band. No one knows his real name. And from the moment I met him, he made me forget mine. In order to convince Sculpt to give me self-defense lessons, I had to follow his one rule no complaining or he d walk. I didn t think it would be a problem. I could handle a few bruises. What I hadn t anticipated was landing on my back with Sculpt on top of me and my entire body burning up for him. I tried to ignore it. I failed of course. And having a hot, tattooed badass on top of me week after week, acting completely immune to what he was doing to my body it was frustrating as hell, so I broke his rule I complained. Then he kissed me. Author s Note: This novella is Sculpt and Emily s beginning and how they met. It is an extra and not required to be read before Torn from You . Their story and what happens to them is the novel Torn from You . *Warning* Huge cliff-hanger. Like huge! But With You and Torn from You are released on the same day.*
