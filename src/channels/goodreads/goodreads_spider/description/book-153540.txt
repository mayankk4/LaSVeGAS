153540:::::The Little House:::::Virginia Lee Burton won the Caldecott Medal in 1943 for her memorable picture book The Little House , a poignant story of a cute country cottage that becomes engulfed by the city that grows up around it. The house has an expressive face of windows and doors, and even the feelings of a person, so she s sad when she s surrounded by the dirty, noisy city s hustle and bustle: She missed the field of daisies / and the apple trees dancing in the moonlight. Fortunately, there s a happy ending, as the house is taken back to the country where she belongs.
