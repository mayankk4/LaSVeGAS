Once the discovery is made, Juan has to fight his nemesis, Diego Columbus, son of famed explorer Christopher Columbus. During the battle, however, Diego is mortally wounded and Juan is forced to save Diego s life by taking him to the mythical Garden of Eden where he can be healed. A transformation happens and Juan and Diego become leaders in an ancient fight against a band of fallen angels known as the Watchers. The Watchers learn the whereabouts of the Ark of the Covenant and use the power within the Ark to take over creation. Juan and Diego lead a group of assembled warriors against the angels, their sons the Nephilim and a mysterious people known as the Elioud.
