17657206:::::Behind Blue Eyes:::::Cain was born in England in 1917. At the end of WWII Cain returned to England, longing for the comforts of home, but found his mother was different; she had been changed by a vampire who preys on women. There came a point where his mother felt there was no choice Cain had to be turned as well. After watching his mother die he changed his way of thinking, his way of feeding. He tried to reclaim some of his humanity but it was not easy as he was fueled by rage against the one that had changed her. He wanted his revenge and nothing would stop him. After he was attacked he came across a young girl, ten year old Mia, whose innocence was slowly being taken away from her. They needed each other, and both their lives depended on it. The world was a very bad place for Mia. She was about to find out just how much worse it could get.
