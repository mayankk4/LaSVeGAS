18400770:::::Attrition: the First Act of Penance:::::Witness Attrition: the First Act of Penance - the stunning debut novel by 18-year-old author SG Night! Set in a rich, dynamic world brimming with a cast of unforgettable characters, this new epic fantasy brings to life a tale of sword-and-sorcery, tyranny and rebellion, conspiracy and assassination, demons, love, and magic. The Demonic Dominion has held the nation of Io captive for more than a century. The Humans are in shackles. The Elves are in exile. And the race of Majiski battle-mages have been all but eradicated by the Demons and their ilk. Racath Thanjel is among the few remaining Majiski surviving in secret. A strong but opinionated young assassin, he works from the shadows against the Demonic Dominion. But how can he and the others hope to defeat such a terrible adversary? Especially when their patriarch is keeping more secrets than the Demons themselves. Now, as a tangle of conspiracies, secrets, and ancient prophecies sweeps Racath away, he must choose his destiny: will he become the long-awaited Savior of Io, or allow it to suffocate beneath the Dominion's iron fist?
