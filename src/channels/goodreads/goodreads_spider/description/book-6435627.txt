6435627:::::I Will Always Love You:::::Blair, Serena, Nate, Dan, and Vanessa went off to live their lives. Now they're coming home for the holidays. A lot can change in a few months... but some things never do. It finally happened: we went to college. We started over.

We've learned new things, made new friends, and maybe even met the loves of our lives. We've changed. Or at least, some of us have. But old habits are hard to break-especially when faced with your former besties and former flames.

Let the games begin! You know you love me, gossip girl
