29348304:::::So Much More:::::Love is strange. It comes out of nowhere. There s no logic to it. It s not methodical. It s not scientific. It s pure emotion and passion. And emotion and passion can be dangerous because they fuel love and hate. I m now a reluctant connoisseur of both an expert through immersion. I know them intimately. When I fell in love with Miranda, it was swift and blind. She was the person I d elevated to mythical status in my head, in my dreams. Here s the thing about dreams, they re smoke. They re spun as thoughts until they become something we think we want. Something we think we need. That was Miranda. She was smoke. I thought I wanted her. I thought I needed her. Over time reality crept in and slowly dissected and disemboweled my dreams like a predator, leaving behind a rotting carcass. Reality can be a fierce bitch. So can Miranda. And I can be a fool... who believes in dreams. And people. And love. Note from the author: Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is recommended for mature audiences only.
