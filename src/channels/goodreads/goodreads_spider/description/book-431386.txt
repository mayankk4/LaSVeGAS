431386:::::Trading Places:::::Bestselling author Fern Michaels creates breathtaking excitement with this page-turning novel of twin sisters who pull off a daring identity switch that lands them in the middle of love and danger. Atlanta police detective Aggie Jade is still recovering from the raid that took the life of her partner and former boyfriend -- and nearly killed her and her beloved K-9. She's not ready to hit the streets again, but she's desperate to hunt down the cop killers who shattered her world. That's when she asks her identical twin sister to trade places with her.... Lizzie Jade is as flashy and fiery as Aggie is quiet and conservative -- and the high-rolling Vegas gambler loves a challenge: turning in her stiletto heels for a badge is the perfect role for Aggie's "wild card" sister. But the gutsy charade gets complicated when sexy investigative reporter Nathan Hawke senses something bold and new about "Aggie," who no longer shies away from his flirtations. As Lizzie and Nathan join forces to uncover a web of lies and corruption, Lizzie finds herself giving in to his charms. But how can she confess that she's not who he thinks she is? And how can she let herself fall in love when she and her twin might have to run for their lives?
