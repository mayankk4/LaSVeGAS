32326888:::::The Mafia and His Angel: Part 1:::::"He stole an Angel from the Devil..." Alessio Cold. Ruthless. Killer. I am respected and feared by all. I wasn t put on this earth to love or be loved. I was put here to wipe out every last member of the damn Abandonato mafia, to pay them back for my mother s death. When I find a strange girl hiding, beaten, under my bed, I don t let her live out of compassion. She s a trinket, my plaything. Ayla I thought Alessio was only one more man who wanted to use me, hurt me, and throw me away. I don t know what it is to trust anymore. I can t find my heart under the pain. Alessio found it. He touched it, and brought it alive again. But if he discovers just how dangerous I am to him I ll lose my life.
