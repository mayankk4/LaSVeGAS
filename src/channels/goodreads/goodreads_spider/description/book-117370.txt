117370:::::Walking in Circles Before Lying Down:::::Dawn Tarnauer s life isn t exactly a success story. Already twice divorced, the young Californian is too busy job-hopping to start a career, her current boyfriend insists on living off the grid, her Life Coach sister perpetually interferes with incomprehensible affirmations, her eccentric mother is busy promoting the culmination of her life s work: The Every Holiday Tree, and her father is ending his brief third marriage while scheduling two dates for the same night. Dawn s only source of security and comfort, it seems, is Chuck, a pit-bull mix from the pound. So, when her boyfriend announces that he s leaving her for another woman, a despairing Dawn turns to Chuck for solace. I should have said something sooner, Chuck confides, as he tries to console her. Couldn t you smell her on his pants? Dawn is stunned. It s one thing to talk to your pets, but what do you do when they start talking back? It s not just Chuck, either; she can hear all dogs and man s best friend has a lot to say. The ever-enthusiastic Chuck offers his tried-and-true advice on the merits of knocking over garbage and strewing it everywhere, auxiliary competitive peeing etiquette, and the curative powers of tossing a ball. Doubtful of her own sanity, Dawn considers that, in the ways of life and love, it might be better to trust Chuck s doggie instincts instead of her own. Filled with sharp wit, biting humor, and canine conversation that would make Doctor Dolittle s jaw drop, Merrill Markoe s engaging, cleverly written novel is about the confusing search for love and the divine acts of dog.
