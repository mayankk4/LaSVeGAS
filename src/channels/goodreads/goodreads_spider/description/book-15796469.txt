It is then that the realization of my unavoidable fate sinks in; I am of a dying race. I am dragon. Aurora Megalos, orphaned and teetering on the edge of adulthood, thought finding her past would curb the sting of being an outcast. Having no memories of the time before she awoke on her foster mother s doorstep, she yearns for the emptiness inside her to be filled. With her fellow orphaned best friend, Fenn, by her side, she has nothing to lose and everything to gain. But something powerful stirred within her that she couldn t explain. Something wanted out. In the dark of night, a crazed Seer, dubbed Mr.Creepy, erases everything she s ever known with an impending prophecy. She now faces two paths. Return to her true home to protect a dying race against a growing evil, or stay hidden in the safety of our realm with a shot at a true love. With a vengeful Arch Enemy stopping at nothing to see her dead, she s running out of time; a decision must be made. What would you choose?
