17880714:::::Crashed:::::When life crashes down around us, how hard are we willing to fight for the one thing we can t live without, each other? Life is full of moments. Big moments. Little moments. And none of them are inconsequential. Every single moment prepares you for that one instance that defines your life. You must overcome all your fears, confront the demons that chase you, and cleanse the poison that clings to your soul or you risk the chance of losing everything. Mine started the minute Rylee fell out of that damn storage closet. She made me feel. Made me whole when all I thought I could ever be was incomplete. Became the lifeline I never knew I needed. Hell yes, she s worth the fight but how do you fight for someone you know you don t deserve? Love is full of ups and downs. Heart stopping highs. Soul shattering lows. And none of them are insignificant. Love is a racecourse of unexpected twists and turns that must be negotiated. You have to break down walls, learn to trust, and heal from your past in order to win. But sometimes it s the expected that s the hardest to hold on to. Colton has healed and completed me, stolen my heart, and made me realize our love s not predictable nor perfect it s bent. And bent s okay. But when outside factors put our relationship to the test, what lengths will I have to go to prove to him that he s worth the fight? Whoever said love is patient and love is kind, never met the two of us. We know our love is worth it have acknowledged that we were meant to be but when our pasts crash into our future, will the repercussions make us stronger or break us apart?
