22056739:::::Mexican Eskimo Book 1: Exmikan:::::ABOUT THE BOOK: "Mexican Eskimo" is a story for grown-ups: a love story about finding trust and hope amidst generations of anger and neglect, suicide and substance abuse. A faithful documentation of a most unlikely existence, "Mexican Eskimo" is an intricate layer-cake of actual and imagined pieces of dimly remembered facts, generously frosted with sweet, sticky gobs of gospel-truth fantasies. The story is peppered with international flavor, vibrant characters, multi-cultural themes, and lush settings. It is rife with magical realism, and also features a large cast of young protagonists struggling with identity conflicts and independence, described in a range of historical periods from the 1850's, 1930's, the present day, and even in worlds that existed so long before now that time itself had not yet started to be counted in years.
