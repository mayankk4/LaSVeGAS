Downton Abbey meets The Selection in this dystopian tale of love and betrayal In a fragmented future United States ruled by the lavish gentry, seventeen-year-old Madeline Landry dreams of going to the university.

But her world is turned upside down when she discovers the devastating consequences her lifestyle is having on those less fortunate. As Madeline begins to question everything she has ever learned, she finds herself increasingly drawn to handsome, beguiling David Dana. Soon, rumors of war and rebellion start to spread, and Madeline finds herself and David at the center of it all. Ultimately, she must make a choice between duty - her family and the estate she loves dearly - and desire.
