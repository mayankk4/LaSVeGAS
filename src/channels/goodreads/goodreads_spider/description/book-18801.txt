18801:::::The Captive & The Fugitive:::::The Modern Library s fifth volume of In Search of Lost Time contains both The Captive (1923) and The Fugitive (1925). In The Captive , Proust s narrator describes living in his mother s Paris apartment with his lover, Albertine, and subsequently falling out of love with her. In The Fugitive , the narrator loses Albertine forever. Rich with irony, The Captive and The Fugitive inspire meditations on desire, sexual love, music, and the art of introspection. For this authoritative English-language edition, D. J. Enright has revised the late Terence Kilmartin s acclaimed reworking of C. K. Scott Moncrieff s translation to take into account the new definitive French editions of la recherch du temps perdu (the final volume of these new editions was published by the Biblioth que de la Pl iade in 1989).
