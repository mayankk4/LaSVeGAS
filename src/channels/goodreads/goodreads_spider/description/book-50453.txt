50453:::::Hot Water Music:::::With his characteristic raw and minimalist style, Charles Bukowski takes us on a walk through his side of town in Hot Water Music . He gives us little vignettes of depravity and lasciviousness, bite sized pieces of what is both beautiful and grotesque. The stories in Hot Water Music dash around the worst parts of town a motel room stinking of sick, a decrepit apartment housing a perpetually arguing couple, a bar tended by a skeleton and depict the darkest parts of human existence. Bukowski talks simply and profoundly about the underbelly of the working class without raising judgement. In the way he writes about sex, relationships, writing, and inebriation, Bukowski sets the bar for irreverent art his work inhabits the basest part of the mind and the most extreme absurdity of the everyday.
