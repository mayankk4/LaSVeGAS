Nineteenth-century America is practical, precarious, and unsentimental, and scarred by the continuing injustice of slavery.

Eventually she must decide if she too can act on what she believes in, whatever the personal costs. A powerful journey brimming with color and drama, The Last Runaway is Tracy Chevalier s vivid engagement with an iconic part of American history.
