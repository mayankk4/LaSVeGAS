Though Drea runs, Salinas knows she can t hide and he dispatches a cold-blooded assassin in hot pursuit, resulting in a tragic turn of events. Or does it? Left for dead, Drea miraculously returns to the realm of the living a changed woman. She s no longer shallow and selfish, no longer steals or cheats or sells herself short.

But in order to feel safe and sound and stop nervously looking over her shoulder she will need to take down those who marked her for death. Joining forces with the FBI, supplying vital inside information that only she can provide, Drea finds herself working with the most dangerous man she s ever known. Yet the closer they get to danger, the more intense their feelings for each other become, and the more Drea realizes that the cost of her new life may be her life itself as well as her heart.
