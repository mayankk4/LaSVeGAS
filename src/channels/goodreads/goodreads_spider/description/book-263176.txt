263176:::::I'm the Vampire, That's Why:::::Broken Heart is the city with the highest rate of divorce and highest percentage of single parents in Oklahoma. And I, Jessica Matthews, have been a member of that club ever since my husband dumped me for his twentysomething secretary and then had the gall to die in a car accident. Now I m not just a single mother trying to make ends meet in this crazy world....I m also a vampire. One minute I was taking out the garbage; the next I awoke sucking on the thigh of superhot vampire Patrick O Halloran, who d generously offered his femoral artery to save me. But though my stretch marks have disappeared and my vision has improved, I can t rest until the thing that did this to me is caught. My kids future is at stake figuratively and literally. As is my sex life. Although I wouldn t mind finding myself attached to Patrick s juicy thigh again, I learned that once a vampire does the dirty deed, it hitches her to the object of her affection for at least one hundred years. I just don t know if I m ready for that kind of commitment....
