21721:::::A Faint Cold Fear:::::The third pulse-pounding novel in the Grant County series from New York Times bestselling author Karin Slaughter. Sara Linton, medical examiner in the small town of Heartsdale, Georgia, is called out to an apparent suicide on the local college campus.

But, bruised and angered by her expulsion from the force, Lena seems to be barely capable of protecting herself, let alone saving the next victim...
