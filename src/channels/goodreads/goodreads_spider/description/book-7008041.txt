7008041:::::The Ghost and the Goth:::::Alona Dare Senior in high school, co-captain of the cheerleading squad, Homecoming Queen three years in a row, voted most likely to marry a movie star and newly dead. I m the girl you hated in high school. Is it my fault I was born with it all-good looks, silky blond hair, a hot body, and a keen sense of what everyone else should not be wearing? But my life isn t perfect, especially since I died. Run over by a bus of band geeks is there anything more humiliating? As it turns out, yes watching your boyfriend and friends move on with life, only days after your funeral. And you wouldn t believe what they re saying about me now that they think I can t hear them. To top it off, I m starting to disappear, flickering in and out of existence. I don t know where I go when I m gone, but it s not good. Where is that freaking white light already? Will Killian Senior in high school, outcast, dubbed Will Kill by the popular crowd for the unearthly aura around him, voted most likely to rob a bank and a ghost-talker. I can see, hear, and touch the dead. Unfortunately, they can also see, hear and touch me. Yeah, because surviving high school isn t hard enough already. I ve done my best to hide my gift. After all, my dad, who shared my ability, killed himself because of it when I was fifteen. But lately, pretending to be normal has gotten a lot harder. A new ghost an anonymous, seething cloud of negative energy with the capacity to throw me around is pursuing me with a vengeance. My mom, who knows nothing about what I can do, is worrying about the increase in odd incidents, my shrink is tossing around terms like temporary confinement for psychiatric evaluation, and my principal, who thinks I m a disruption and a faker, is searching for every way possible to get rid of me. How many weeks until graduation?
