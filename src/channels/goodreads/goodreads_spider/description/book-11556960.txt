11556960:::::Crewel:::::Incapable. Awkward. Artless. That s what the other girls whisper behind her back. But sixteen-year-old Adelice Lewys has a secret: She wants to fail. Gifted with the ability to weave time with matter, she s exactly what the Guild is looking for, and in the world of Arras, being chosen to work the looms is everything a girl could want. It means privilege, eternal beauty, and being something other than a secretary. It also means the power to manipulate the very fabric of reality. But if controlling what people eat, where they live, and how many children they have is the price of having it all, Adelice isn t interested. Not that her feelings matter, because she slipped and used her hidden talent for a moment. Now she has one hour to eat her mom s overcooked pot roast. One hour to listen to her sister s academy gossip and laugh at her dad s jokes. One hour to pretend everything s okay. And one hour to escape. Because tonight, they ll come for her.
