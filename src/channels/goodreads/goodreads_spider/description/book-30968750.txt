30968750:::::#Bae:::::This fall... Happily-ever-after. That s what happens when you get married. Right? Turns out sparkly rings, cake and a fantastic wedding do not automatically grant you that, not even when it s all you truly want. I m even starting to doubt the bottomless, unconditional love I share with the man I married will be enough. I can t have happily ever after, know why? Because I can t give Romeo what he truly wants. I ve tried. So hard. I won t be happy unless he is and something is missing. Someone. Paparazzi are in my face. The flashing cameras and prying eyes are everywhere. My secret is getting harder to hide, and I know the second the scoop is dished the grip I have on the fraying rope of that happily ever after will snap right in my face. In our face. I can t let that happen. No matter what. Because with or without a happy ending, Romeo comes Before Anyone Else.
