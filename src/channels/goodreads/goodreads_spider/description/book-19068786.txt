19068786:::::Holding On:::::How does a person decide if their own life is worth sacrificing to save another? Shame holds onto a past that haunts him. Damaged by the parents that should have taught him unconditional love; they imprisoned him with violence and disregard. Even now, Shame struggles to find both the independence and love he deserves. Knowing the blood that runs through him is stained merely by reputation, Hem seeks acceptance while he searches for ways to redeem himself in the eyes of those that have judged him his entire life. Together the two have committed themselves to one purpose; protecting those they love the most. Mace Cash is Hem s younger sister. Although they share the same mother, Mace s father despises Hem and his position within the family. Sadey Lyons has loved Hem all of her life. Swearing to save herself for him, she s determined to wait for him for as long as it takes; wanting only for him to see her as the woman she has become and not the little girl he s always cherished. When Hem and Shame meet Doc, the President of Lights of Peril Motorcycle Club, their lives take a dramatic turn. Finally escaping from a past that has controlled them, they find themselves living free. But neither of them have known peace for long... This is their story of love, loyalty, and heartbreak.
