8379666:::::Whisper Falls:::::Welcome to Destiny, Ohio where coming home means finding your true heart and maybe even your true love. Tessa Sheridan came crawling back home to Destiny after her big city interior design career crumbled. Now not only must she struggle to make ends meet, she has to contend with a biker next door and the roar of Harleys shattering the serenity of her cabin in the woods. Worse still, her sexy bad boy neighbor makes her feel breathless and weak and shy, petite Tessa knows what a major mistake it would be to get involved with someone so dangerous. They say that former teen rebel Lucky Romo has a dark, secret past that he s trouble with a capital T. Still, Tessa feels all tingly when she sees how well he fills out a pair of tight jeans. And when Lucky invites her into his world, she knows the intense heat sparking between them could lead her somewhere wild and wonderful and, yes, dangerous!
