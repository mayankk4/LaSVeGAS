24724:::::Drop City:::::It is 1970, and a down-at-the-heels California commune devoted to peace, free love, and the simple life has decided to relocate to the last frontier the unforgiving landscape of interior Alaska in the ultimate expression of going back to the land. Armed with the spirit of adventure and na ve optimism, the inhabitants of Drop City arrive in the wilderness of Alaska only to find their utopia already populated by other young homesteaders. When the two communities collide, unexpected friendships and dangerous enmities are born as everyone struggles with the bare essentials of life: love, nourishment, and a roof over one s head. Rich, allusive, and unsentimental, T.C. Boyle s ninth novel is a tour de force infused with the lyricism and take-no-prisoners storytelling for which he is justly famous.
