Can curlers, girdles, Vaseline, and a strand of pearls help Maya on her quest to be popular? The real-life results are painful, funny, and include a wonderful and unexpected surprise meeting and befriending Betty Cornell herself. Told with humor and grace, Maya s journey offers readers of all ages a thoroughly contemporary example of kindness and self-confidence.
