Our story was supposed to end right after the orgasms, right after we went our separate ways. But then we saw each other again And neither of us could walk away. Our rules were simple. Our passion was scandalous. Our hearts were supposed to be safe But when you find something so all-consuming something so intoxicating and inescapable, you ll risk everything you ve ever had, even if you re destined to crash and burn. This is us. This is our messed up love. This is turbulence.
