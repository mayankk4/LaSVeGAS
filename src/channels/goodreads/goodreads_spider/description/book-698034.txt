698034:::::Time Out of Joint:::::Time Out of Joint is Philip K. Dick s classic depiction of the disorienting disparity between the world as we think it is and the world as it actually is. The year is 1998, although Ragle Gumm doesn t know that. He thinks it s 1959. He also thinks that he served in World War II, that he lives in a quiet little community, and that he really is the world s long-standing champion of newspaper puzzle contests. It is only after a series of troubling hallucinations that he begins to suspect otherwise. And once he pursues his suspicions, he begins to see how he is the center of a universe gone terribly awry.
