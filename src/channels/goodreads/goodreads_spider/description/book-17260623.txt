Soon, she loses control of the lonely world she built around her, and the past, present, and future collide. Three guys are there when it all comes crashing down: JT, the perfect boyfriend she never wanted to give up; Rhye, the local bad boy rock star who made her forget the past; and Kane, the funny and sweet tattooed bartender who wants her future. Secrets must be kept. Choices must be made. Is it possible to move forward while still chained to the wicked vices of the past?
