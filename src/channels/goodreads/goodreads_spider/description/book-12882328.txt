Kieran has led the boys safely up to this point, and now that the girls are back, their mission seems slightly less impossible: to chase down the New Horizon, and save their parents from the enemy ship. But nothing is truly as it seems Kieran s leadership methods have raised Seth s hackles and Waverly s suspicions. Is this really her fianc ? The handsome, loving boy she was torn from just a short time before? More and more, she finds her thoughts aligned with Seth s. But if Seth is Kieran s Enemy No. 1, what does that make her?

With the balance of power precarious and the clock ticking, every decision counts every step brings them closer to a new beginning, or a sudden end...
