13573795:::::Ceaseless:::::Can he make her fall in love with him again? When Pagan Moore proved worthy of Death s devotion, he was given the gift of getting to keep her. But Dank was never promised that Pagan would keep him. When a soul is created, so is its mate. In every lifetime those souls find each other. They complete the other s destiny. It s time for Pagan s soul to choose if she truly wants an eternity at Death s side or if she wants the mate created just for her. Dank didn t think he had to worry about her choice. He knew where her heart belonged. Until he realized that every kiss, every touch, every moment of their time together would be washed from her memories. He would have to win her heart all over again and prove to her soul that he was where she belonged. If only her soul s mate wasn t right there standing in his way.
