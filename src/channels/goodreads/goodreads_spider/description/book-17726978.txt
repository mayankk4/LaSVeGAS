The future, in which they plan to get married and start a family, is bright. The other residents of their building seem friendly too: the horror writer and the middle-aged herbalist who live upstairs, and the Newtons, a married couple who welcome them to the building with open arms. At first, the two couples get on well. But then strange things start to happen. Dead rats are left on their doorstep. They hear disturbing noises, and much worse, in the night. After Jamie's best friend is injured in a horrific accident, Jamie and Kirsty find themselves targeted by a campaign of terror. As Jamie and Kirsty are driven to the edge of despair, Jamie vows to fight back but he has no idea what he is really up against THE MAGPIES is a terrifying psychological thriller in which the monsters are not vampires or demons but the people we live next door to. It is a nightmare that could happen to anyone. "A nailbiter of suspense with terrific characterisation." Peter James on KILLING CUPID (Sunday Express Books of the Year 2012) "Masterfully done...They make slick, well-plotted, ridiculously tense thrillers look deceptively easy to write' Matt Haig on CATCH YOUR DEATH "A very clever, very pacey story that kept me guessing right to the end." Elizabeth Haynes on KILLING CUPID
