7778981:::::Halo:::::An angel is sent to Earth on a mission. But falling in love is not part of the plan. Three angels Gabriel, the warrior; Ivy, the healer; and Bethany, the youngest and most human are sent by Heaven to bring good to a world falling under the influence of darkness. They work hard to conceal their luminous glow, superhuman powers, and, most dangerous of all, their wings, all the while avoiding all human attachments. Then Bethany meets Xavier Woods, and neither of them is able to resist the attraction between them. Gabriel and Ivy do everything in their power to intervene, but the bond between Xavier and Bethany seems too strong. The angel s mission is urgent, and dark forces are threatening. Will love ruin Bethany or save her?
