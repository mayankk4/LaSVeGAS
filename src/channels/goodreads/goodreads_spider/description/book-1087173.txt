1087173:::::Chobits, Vol. 8:::::Chi has developed quite a bit since Hideki found her lying in the garbage one fateful morning. She's learned to speak, work in a pastry shop, go shopping...and, so it would seem, to love. After much soul searching (if a persocom could even be considered to have a soul) Chi comes to the realization that her feelings towards Hideki, her "someone just fer her," are nothing short of love. Only two obstacles stand between her and happiness. First there's Hideki; he's been struggling with the idea that a person can have feelings for a machine. Can her return her love? Second is the mysterious Zima and Dita. Having run out of patience, they're quickly closing in to deactivate Chi before her strong emotions pose a threat to persocoms everywhere. Chapters 82 88
