21474459:::::Frenched:::::When I got dumped by my stupid fianc a week before the wedding, my plans involved nothing more than ice cream, a blanket fort, and a bonfire of his possessions. But my friends convinced me that bitter tastes better drowned in Bordeaux, so I came to Paris for a single-moon. Then I met him. He's shown me things I ve never seen before, and I m not talking about the Louvre. Is it just the seduction of Paris? Or could this be the real thing?
