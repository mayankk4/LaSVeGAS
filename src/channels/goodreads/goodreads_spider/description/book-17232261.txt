17232261:::::Songs of Willow Frost:::::Twelve-year-old William Eng, a Chinese-American boy, has lived at Seattle s Sacred Heart Orphanage ever since his mother s listless body was carried away from their small apartment five years ago. On his birthday or rather, the day the nuns designate as his birthday William and the other orphans are taken to the historical Moore Theatre, where William glimpses an actress on the silver screen who goes by the name of Willow Frost. Struck by her features, William is convinced that the movie star is his mother, Liu Song. Determined to find Willow, and prove his mother is still alive, William escapes from Sacred Heart with his friend Charlotte. The pair navigates the streets of Seattle, where they must not only survive, but confront the mysteries of William s past and his connection to the exotic film star. The story of Willow Frost, however, is far more complicated than the Hollywood fantasy William sees onscreen. Shifting between the Great Depression and the 1920s, Songs of Willow Frost takes readers on an emotional journey of discovery. Jamie Ford s sweeping book will resonate with anyone who has ever longed for the comforts of family and a place to call home.
