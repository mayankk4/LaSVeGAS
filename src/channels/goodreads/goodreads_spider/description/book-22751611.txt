22751611:::::Liberty Belle:::::Navy Seaman Kyle Reese meets a beautiful red head who has a secret...or ten. Things heat up beyond his wildest dreams, but he has a secret, too. Will it ruin his dream relationship or will he win the girl in the end? Some desires never end, and some broken hearts never mend. Join Kyle as he's faced with the toughest choice of his young clandestine military career. Do you ever wonder how the news becomes the news? More often than not, clandestine special operations are involved in many of the events you read, hear and watch on a daily basis. Unlike the SEAL TEAM 6 raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Abadabad, Pakistan, you'll never know this 99.9% of the time because these shadow forces are so good at what they do...but every now and then... Get a look inside what really happens behind the scenes...in the shadows... Everyone knows Navy SEALS exist...they are the public heroes and heartthrobs of the military. This is a story about one of the guys no one knows exist...who gets the military intelligence that makes the Navy Special Warfare Special Operators rock stars. Everything he does is done the hard way...he's a spy...a patriot...and an unsung hero you'll never see being awarded medals for work most men would run from. His work is dangerous, covert, and if caught, his very existence is denied by the U.S. Government...he's on his own. But first, he must prove himself through a real-world operational screening program. It seems easy enough at first, but complications begin to cast doubt as he ends up doing things he never anticipated...including falling in love.
