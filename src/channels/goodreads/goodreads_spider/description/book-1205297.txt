1205297:::::Playing for Pizza:::::Rick Dockery was the third-string quarterback for the Cleveland Browns. In the AFC Championship game against Denver, to the surprise and dismay of virtually everyone, Rick actually got into the game. With a 17-point lead and just minutes to go, Rick provided what was arguably the worst single performance in the history of the NFL. Overnight, he became a national laughingstock and, of course, was immediately cut by the Browns and shunned by all other teams. But all Rick knows is football, and he insists that his agent, Arnie, find a team that needs him. Against enormous odds Arnie finally locates just such a team and informs Rick that, miraculously, he can in fact now be a starting quarterback for the mighty Panthers of Parma, Italy. Yes, Italians do play American football, to one degree or another, and the Parma Panthers desperately want a former NFL player any former NFL player at their helm. So Rick reluctantly agrees to play for the Panthers at least until a better offer comes along and heads off to Italy. He knows nothing about Parma, has never been to Europe, and doesn t speak or understand a word of Italian. To say that Italy holds a few surprises for Rick Dockery would be something of an understatement.
