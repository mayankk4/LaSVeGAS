99713:::::A Coney Island of the Mind:::::The title of this book is taken from Henry Miller's "Into the Night Life" and expresses the way Lawrence Ferlinghetti felt about these poems when he wrote them during a short period in the 1950's as if they were, taken together, a kind of Coney Island of the mind, a kind of circus of the soul.
