11517416:::::Past Perfect:::::A sweet and clever novel about the woes of (boy) history repeating itself, from the author of Mostly Good Girls . All Chelsea wants to do this summer is hang out with her best friend, hone her talents as an ice cream connoisseur, and finally get over Ezra, the boy who broke her heart. But when Chelsea shows up for her summer job at Essex Historical Colonial Village (yes, really), it turns out Ezra s working there too. Which makes moving on and forgetting Ezra a lot more complicated even when Chelsea starts falling for someone new. Maybe Chelsea should have known better than to think that a historical reenactment village could help her escape her past. But with Ezra all too present, and her new crush seeming all too off-limits, all Chelsea knows is that she s got a lot to figure out about love. Because those who don t learn from the past are doomed to repeat it
