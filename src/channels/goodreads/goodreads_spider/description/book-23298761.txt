23298761:::::Serial Killer Groupies:::::Ted Bundy received hundreds of love letters from women every week while he was in prison. Women not only sent fan love mail, but marriage proposals, money and gifts. The same goes for Jeffrey Dahmer, Richard Ramirez, John Wayne Gacy and many other notorious and not so famous serial killers. Groupies will do almost anything to get close to the prisoner that they are attracted to. They give up jobs, family, spend money on him, and even move across country to be in the same town as him. Most Serial Killer Groupies (SKG's) are attractive and well educated, for example, Doreen Lioy who married Ramirez had an above-average IQ of 152 and a University Degree. Many are already married, they are mothers, and in several cases, they work in law enforcement or psychology. They sometimes wait for hours just to have a few minutes every week or so to have a face-to-face visit in the prison. Some SKG's are attracted to the celebrity status they acquire. They go on talk shows to announce their undying love for the serial killer and proclaim that he was not capable of these killings. Or, that he has changed. Some have taken credit for 'changing' the killer and that he's been regenerated. The research and writing of Serial Killer Groupies started in 2012 after an interview I had with Paul Bernardo, who receives copious amounts of fan mail each month. This book depicts several cases of fan fare some killers receive and known medical conditions that many 'groupies' have.
