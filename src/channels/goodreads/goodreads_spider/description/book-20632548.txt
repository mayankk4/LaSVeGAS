20632548:::::Biker Bait:::::Alannah Blake was born and raised in The Lost Souls Motorcycle Club. She grown up surrounded by men dressed in leather, blood on their hands and living by a code society deems morally corrupt. She couldn't be happier at the thought of finishing college and returning home to the men she regards as her uncles and brothers, her family. While she's been at college, she's been hidden from the ever growing, never ending feud between her uncle's club and The Raging Riders MC. Her uncle -Michael Blake- The Lost Souls president is under pressure against their rivals. In a game that long ago began, he makes decisions that place not only his brothers in danger, but everyone connected to the club, including Alannah. Castiel 'Cas' Jackson is the Vice President of The Lost Souls MC and gave up the only thing that ever meant anything to him when his VP patch is threatened. His loyalty to his brothers and his club has never been a problem, until he got close to the presidents niece - Alannah Blake. After breaking her heart before she left for college, can he keep his word to stay away from her now she's back? With Michael's decisions affecting the club and Alannah, can Cas figure out his presidents secrets before it's too late for Alannah and the club?
