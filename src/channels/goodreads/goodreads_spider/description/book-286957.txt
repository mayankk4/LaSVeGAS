286957:::::The Yellow Wall-Paper:::::It is stripped off - the paper - in great patches . . . The colour is repellent . . . In the places where it isn t faded and where the sun is just so - I can see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure, that seems to skulk about . . . Based on the author s own experiences, 'The Yellow Wallpaper' is the chilling tale of a woman driven to the brink of insanity by the rest cure prescribed after the birth of her child. Isolated in a crumbling colonial mansion, in a room with bars on the windows, the tortuous pattern of the yellow wallpaper winds its way into the recesses of her mind. Charlotte Perkins Gilman was America s leading feminist intellectual of the early twentieth century. In addition to her masterpiece 'The Yellow Wallpaper', this new edition includes a selection of her best short fiction and extracts from her autobiography.
