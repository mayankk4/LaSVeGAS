13065142:::::Rock Chick Reckoning:::::Stella s the lead singer and lead guitarist of The Blue Moon Gypsies and Stella used to be Mace s girl. Mace broke up with her, though, and the loss of him rocked her world. But Stella gets a call, late at night (again) from one of the members of her crazy band. She has to go play clean up (again) and runs into Mace and a shed load of police, and ends up getting shot. Mace finds he doesn t like it much that his ex-girlfriend got shot right in front of him but it s worse. A very bad man has thrown down the gauntlet and all the Rock Chicks are in the firing line. Stella doesn t want Mace to be the one to keep her alive, but she has no choice. Mainly because Mace isn t giving her one.
