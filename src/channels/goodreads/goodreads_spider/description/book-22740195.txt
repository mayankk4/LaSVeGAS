22740195:::::The World of Ice and Fire: The Untold History of Westeros and the Game of Thrones:::::The never-before-seen history of Westeros and the lands beyond. With hundreds of pages of all-new material from George R.R. Martin. If the past is prologue, then George R. R. Martin s masterwork the most inventive and entertaining fantasy saga of our time warrants one hell of an introduction. At long last, it has arrived with The World of Ice and Fire. This lavishly illustrated volume is a comprehensive history of the Seven Kingdoms, providing vividly constructed accounts of the epic battles, bitter rivalries, and daring rebellions that lead to the events of A Song of Ice and Fire and HBO s Game of Thrones. In a collaboration that s been years in the making, Martin has teamed with Elio M. Garc a, Jr., and Linda Antonsson, the founders of the renowned fan site Westeros.org perhaps the only people who know this world almost as well as its visionary creator. Collected here is all the accumulated knowledge, scholarly speculation, and inherited folk tales of maesters and septons, maegi and singers. It is a chronicle which stretches from the Dawn Age to the Age of Heroes; from the Coming of the First Men to the arrival of Aegon the Conqueror; from Aegon s establishment of the Iron Throne to Robert s Rebellion and the fall of the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen, which has set into motion the present-day struggles of the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, and Targaryens. The definitive companion piece to George R. R. Martin s dazzlingly conceived universe, The World of Ice and Fire is indeed proof that the pen is mightier than a storm of swords.
