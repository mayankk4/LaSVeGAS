13183957:::::Shadows:::::The last thing Dawson Black expected was Bethany Williams. As a Luxen, an alien life form on Earth, human girls are well, fun. But since the Luxen have to keep their true identities a secret, falling for one would be insane. Dangerous. Tempting. Undeniable. Bethany can t deny the immediate connection between her and Dawson. And even though boys aren t a complication she wants, she can t stay away from him. Still, whenever they lock eyes, she s drawn in. Captivated. Lured. Loved. Dawson is keeping a secret that will change her existence...and put her life in jeopardy. But even he can t stop risking everything for one human girl. Or from a fate that is as unavoidable as love itself.
