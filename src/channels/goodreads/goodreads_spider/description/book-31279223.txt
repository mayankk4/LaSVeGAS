31279223:::::Rapunzelle:::::When a handsome stranger arrives trying to solve a fifteen-year-old mystery, even the most over-protected heroine knows how to let down her hair. Zelle Carpenter loves her parents. She really, really does. It s just that they re soooooo obsessed with keeping her safe that she feels like she s been locked in a tower half the time. There s no chance to go out and have fun, without resorting to a little trickery with her best friend, and there s no chance to meet boys. The only boys she knows are the always-on-their-best-behavior cowboys at Church, and who wants to practice kissing with them? Duke Dmitri Volkov is stuck in this backwater American town for one reason only; to solve the fifteen-year-old mystery about a lost princess that his father shared on his death-bed. But he s not going to pass up the opportunity to kiss a pretty girl, especially if that pretty girl has the most beguiling green eyes and taste for adventure. Despite his best efforts, he s quickly falling for this quaint town and its welcoming citizens. The only thing left is to solve his father s mystery, so that he can start his Happily Ever After. But Dmitri doesn t realize that finding the lost princess from his past will strip away any chance of future happiness in Everland. [Note: This story is the sequel to THE STEPMOTHER.
