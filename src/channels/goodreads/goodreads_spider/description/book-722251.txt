722251:::::Conjure Wife:::::Norman Saylor considered witchcraft nothing but quaint superstition until he learned his own wife was a practising sorceress. Even then, he still refused to accept the truth - one that every woman knows but no man dares to believe - that in the secret occult warfare that governs our everyday lives, witchcraft is a matter of life and death. Conjure Wife is a masterpiece of witchcraft and dark fantasy and the source of the classic horror film Burn Witch Burn !
