18657517:::::Lovely Vicious:::::1. Don't talk about love. 2. Don't think about love. 3. Thinking and talking about love leads to Love, which is the enemy... For 17-year-old Isis Blake, the list has one goal: to ensure she never falls in love again. Ever. As Isis and her mom settle into their new home in Buttcrack-of-Nowhere, Ohio, Isis is rockin' the purple hair and a beat up old car...and hoping like hell that no one learns that a) she used to be fat; and b) she used to have a heart. Naturally, Isis opts for social suicide instead...by punching the cold and untouchably handsome "Ice Prince"-a.k.a. Jack Hunter-right in his smug face. Now the school hallways are an epic battleground as Isis and the Ice Prince engage in a vicious game of social warfare. But sometimes to know your enemy is to love him...
