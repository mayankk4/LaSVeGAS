23734628:::::Carry On:::::Simon Snow is the worst chosen one who s ever been chosen. That s what his roommate, Baz, says. And Baz might be evil and a vampire and a complete git, but he s probably right. Half the time, Simon can t even make his wand work, and the other half, he sets something on fire. His mentor s avoiding him, his girlfriend broke up with him, and there s a magic-eating monster running around wearing Simon s face. Baz would be having a field day with all this, if he were here it s their last year at the Watford School of Magicks, and Simon s infuriating nemesis didn t even bother to show up. Carry On is a ghost story, a love story, a mystery and a melodrama. It has just as much kissing and talking as you d expect from a Rainbow Rowell story but far, far more monsters.
