9917945:::::Perfect:::::Everyone has something, someone, somewhere else that they d rather be. For four high-school seniors, their goals of perfection are just as different as the paths they take to get there. Cara s parents unrealistic expectations have already sent her twin brother Conner spiraling toward suicide. For her, perfect means rejecting their ideals to take a chance on a new kind of love. Kendra covets the perfect face and body no matter what surgeries and drugs she needs to get there. To score his perfect home run on the field and off Sean will sacrifice more than he can ever win back. And Andre realizes that to follow his heart and achieve his perfect performance, he ll be living a life his ancestors would never understand. Everyone wants to be perfect, but when perfection loses its meaning, how far will you go? What would you give up to be perfect?
