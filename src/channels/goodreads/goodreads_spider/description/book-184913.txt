184913:::::Petersburg:::::Taking place over a short, turbulent period in 1905, "Petersburg" is a colourful evocation of Russia's capital a kaleidoscope of images and impressions, an eastern window on the west, a symbol of the ambiguities and paradoxes of the Russian character. History, culture and politics are blended and juxtaposed; weather reports, current news, fashions and psychology jostle together with people from Petersburg society in an exhilarating search for the identity of a city and, ultimately, Russia itself. 'The one novel that sums up the whole of Russia.' Anthony Burgess
