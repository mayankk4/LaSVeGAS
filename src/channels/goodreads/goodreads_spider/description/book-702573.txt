702573:::::Claiming the Highlander:::::BORN TO BE HIS BRIDE? It is said that Braden MacAllister, English baron and proud Highlander warrior, can fell an enemy with a single blow and a woman with a single kiss. But not Maggie, it seems. For the fire-haired beauty, determined to end the long running feud that rages between their clan and its common foe, is immune to Braden's attempts to stop her foolishness. But stop her he will, once he gets the meddling minx alone and favours her with a passionate caress and an irresistible kiss. No matter how she trembles beneath Braden's sensuous touch...he has given his heart to none. But dare she dream that by assuring peace for her clan she may also be claiming the most magnificent Highlander for herself.
