9917925:::::Witchlanders:::::High in their mountain covens, red witches pray to the Goddess, protecting the Witchlands by throwing the bones and foretelling the future. It s all a fake. At least, that s what Ryder thinks. He doubts the witches really deserve their tithes one quarter of all the crops his village can produce. And even if they can predict the future, what danger is there to foretell, now that his people s old enemy, the Baen, has been defeated? But when a terrifying new magic threatens both his village and the coven, Ryder must confront the beautiful and silent witch who holds all the secrets. Everything he s ever believed about witches, the Baen, magic and about himself will change, when he discovers that the prophecies he s always scorned Are about him.
