17455811:::::Bitter Sweet Love:::::Dez wasn't just Jasmine's crush. A gargoyle Warden like Jas, he helped her come to terms with her destiny fending off demons and maintaining the balance between good and evil. He was her everything right until the moment he disappeared without a trace. It didn't help that Jas's father had just announced that she and Dez would one day be mated. Hard not to take that personally. And now he's back, three years older, ten times hotter, ready to pick up exactly where they left off. But Jas isn't taking that risk again. Dez has seven days to meet all her conditions and earn back her trust. Seven days filled with terrifying danger and sweet temptation. Seven days to win her heart or shatter it all over again...
