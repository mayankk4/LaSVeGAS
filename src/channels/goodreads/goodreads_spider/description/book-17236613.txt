17236613:::::My Wolf's Bane:::::NOTE FROM THE PUBLISHER: As with any Veronica Blade book, this is a ROMANCE NOVEL, meaning it's romance FIRST and everything else is secondary. Rated PG-13 for sexual situations and mild profanity. Different species. Mortal enemies. It'll never work, but they'll die trying. Autumn Rossi thought she was a normal teenager. Suddenly, she can outrun every critter in the forest, making her wonder if she s even human. When the new guy at school, Zack de Luca, witnesses a questionable scene, he unfairly pins her as stuck-up. He acts like he hates her, yet he keeps bailing her out of trouble. Not only is Zack both insufferable and irresistible, he seems to sniff her anytime he gets close. As passion flares between them, Autumn isn t sure which is more dangerous: her psycho ex-boyfriend, or falling for Zack who s risking his life just by being near her.
