35993:::::Spirit of Place:::::From one of the century's greatest storytellers comes a collection of essays that capture the "spirit of place." Lawrence Durrell's articles about Mediterranean and Aegean islands along with passages from his letters were first published in 1969. This edition, edited by Durrell's friend and bibliographer Alan C. Thomas, comprises letters spanning thirty years, excerpts from his first two novels (neither available in the U.S.), short fiction, and travel essays. "My books are always about living in places, not just rushing through them.... the important determinant of any culture is after all -- the spirit of place".
