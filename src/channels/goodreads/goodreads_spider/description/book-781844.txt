781844:::::On Death and Dying:::::One of the most important psychological studies of the late twentieth century, On Death and Dying grew out of Dr. Elisabeth K bler-Ross's famous interdisciplinary seminar on death, life, and transition. In this remarkable book, Dr. K bler-Ross first explored the now-famous five stages of death: denial and isolation, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Through sample interviews and conversations, she gives the reader a better understanding of how imminent death affects the patient, the professionals who serve that patient, and the patient's family, bringing hope to all who are involved.
