18879761:::::I Was Here:::::Cody and Meg were inseparable. Two peas in a pod. Until . . . they weren t anymore. When her best friend Meg drinks a bottle of industrial-strength cleaner alone in a motel room, Cody is understandably shocked and devastated. She and Meg shared everything so how was there no warning? But when Cody travels to Meg s college town to pack up the belongings left behind, she discovers that there s a lot that Meg never told her. About her old roommates, the sort of people Cody never would have met in her dead-end small town in Washington. About Ben McAllister, the boy with a guitar and a sneer, who broke Meg s heart. And about an encrypted computer file that Cody can t open until she does, and suddenly everything Cody thought she knew about her best friend s death gets thrown into question. I Was Here is Gayle Forman at her finest, a taut, emotional, and ultimately redemptive story about redefining the meaning of family and finding a way to move forward even in the face of unspeakable loss.
