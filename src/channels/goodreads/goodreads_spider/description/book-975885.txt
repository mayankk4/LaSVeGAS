975885:::::The Vampire Tapestry:::::Edward Weyland is far from your average vampire: not only is he a respected anthropology professor but his condition is biological rather than supernatural. He lives discrete lifetimes bounded by decades of hibernation and steals blood from labs rather than committing murder. Weyland is a monster who must form an uneasy empathy with his prey in order to survive, and The Vampire Tapestry is a story wholly unlike any you've heard before.
