18809943:::::Unexpected Fate:::::Have you ever felt like you were living your life for a future that was predetermined? Like there was some bigger picture you just prayed you would someday see clearly? That picture has been crystal clear to me since I was old enough to recognize it for just what it was. Or I should say recognize him for who he was. I ve loved Cohen Cage since I was a small child. He s been my everything for the last twenty-two years. I ve loved him through every girlfriend he s ever brought home. Through his college years and then mine. I ve loved him through two deployments. And ever since the day I told him how I felt, he s acted like I m a stranger. My name is Danielle Reid, and it s time for me to get my man. Our future is an unexpected fate, and no matter what our parents, siblings, and friends say it s going to be worth every second of the fight to make it happen.
