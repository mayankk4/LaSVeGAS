25534273:::::The Corridor:::::Infinite worlds. Endless possibilities . . . Stel Alaster has never known life without the Corridor. It appeared suddenly seventeen years ago, the only portal to a parallel version of our world Second Earth. Everyone on First Earth fears Mods, the genetically modified Second Earthers who built the Corridor. They are too smart, too strong, and have powers that can t be controlled. Any Mod found on First Earth is branded, then detained in the Corridor s research labs. Only Stel has a dangerous secret. She has a power, too: She can open a portal to Second Earth . . . and several other parallel universes she s discovered. If anyone ever finds out, she ll be imprisoned, no better than a Mod or common lab rat. But when the Corridor starts to fail, emitting erratic bursts of energy that could destroy First Earth, Stel must risk everything to save the people and world she loves. With the help of an escaped Mod and an infuriatingly arrogant boy from a third universe, Stel sets out to unravel the mysteries of the Corridor and stabilize it before it s too late. The fate of every world lies in the balance. . . .
