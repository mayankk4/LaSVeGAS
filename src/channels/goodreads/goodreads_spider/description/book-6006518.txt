6006518:::::Strange Angels:::::In Strange Angels , Dru Anderson has what her grandmother called the touch. (Comes in handy when you re traveling from town to town with your dad, hunting ghosts, suckers, wulfen, and the occasional zombie.) Then her dad turns up dead but still walking and Dru knows she s next. Even worse, she s got two guys hungry for her affections, and they re not about to let the fiercely independent Dru go it alone. Will Dru discover just how special she really is before coming face-to-fang with whatever or whoever is hunting her?
