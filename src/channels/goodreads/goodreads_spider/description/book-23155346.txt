23155346:::::Storm:::::The calm before the storm I lived in the quiet stillness. I felt the wind rustle, warning me, telling me to get out of its path. But I didn t. I never stood a chance. A series of weather and road mishaps leaves me trapped in the middle of a blizzard with a complete stranger. In the back of a pickup truck. For forty-eight freakin hours. A stranger with long hair, tattoos, and rippling with muscle. A stranger with an insanely sexy voice and a wicked smile that turned my insides to jelly. A stranger who held me in his arms, calmed me, and then set a fire in me that I couldn t put out. Storm lives up to his name. Beautiful. Dangerously inviting. Tumultuous. Dark. A clash of hot and cold. He s used to getting everything he wants. And now he wants me. Some people chase storms for the beautiful thrill. What happens when the storm chases you?
