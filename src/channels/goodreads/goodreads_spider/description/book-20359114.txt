20359114:::::Presence:::::Our planet is just one of a bunch Telling a story about the importance of survival within any circumstances, however strange, and showing a girl-in-a-man s-world angle, Presence is a novel about Samantha, a woman in her late twenties, both smart and attractive. One day, Samantha s regular life is suddenly turned around as the fact of her existence is somehow erased from the world. Nobody seems to remember her, her own apartment is occupied by the uninvited tenants, and even her sister, the only family Samantha has, is unable to recognize her. Lost and confused, Samantha accepts help from a stranger, a charismatic man named Archie, whom she accidentally encounters and unwillingly joins him in his fight against the silent invasion of the planet, Alpha planet as he calls it; and he himself happens to be a soldier from a parallel one, Beta . The glass wall put between Samantha s new life and her former life makes her discover the roadside of the world, dark and silent, the hidden place where her primary instincts come to the surface and she finally feels the urge to fight for herself and for others.
