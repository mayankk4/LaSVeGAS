16068905:::::Fangirl:::::From the author of the New York Times bestseller Eleanor &amp; Park . A coming-of-age tale of fan fiction, family and first love. Cath is a Simon Snow fan. Okay, the whole world is a Simon Snow fan... But for Cath, being a fan is her life and she s really good at it. She and her twin sister, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it s what got them through their mother leaving. Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fan fiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere. Cath s sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can t let go. She doesn t want to. Now that they re going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn t want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She s got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend, a fiction-writing professor who thinks fan fiction is the end of the civilized world, a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words... And she can t stop worrying about her dad, who s loving and fragile and has never really been alone. For Cath, the question is: Can she do this? Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? Writing her own stories? And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?
