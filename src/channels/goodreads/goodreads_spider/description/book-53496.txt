"Delicious!" And that is how I happened to tell them about Phoebe, her disappearing mother, and the lunatic. As Sal entertains her grandparents with Phoebe's outrageous story, her own story begins to unfold the story of a thirteen-year-old girl whose only wish is to be reunited with her missing mother.
