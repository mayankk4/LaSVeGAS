22926485:::::Sustained:::::A knight in tarnished armor is still a knight. When you re a defense attorney in Washington, DC, you see firsthand how hard life can be, and that sometimes the only way to survive is to be harder. I, Jake Becker, have a reputation for being cold, callous, and intimidating and that suits me just fine. In fact, it s necessary when I m breaking down a witness on the stand. Complications don t work for me I m a need-to-know type of man. If you re my client, tell me the basic facts. If you re my date, stick to what will turn you on. I m not a therapist or Prince Charming and I don t pretend to be. Then Chelsea McQuaid and her six orphaned nieces and nephews came along and complicated the ever-loving hell out of my life. Now I'm going to Mommy &amp; Me classes, One Direction concerts, the emergency room, and arguing cases in the principal's office. Chelsea s too sweet, too innocent, and too gorgeous for her own good. She tries to be tough, but she s not. She needs someone to help her, defend her and the kids. And that that, I know how to do.
