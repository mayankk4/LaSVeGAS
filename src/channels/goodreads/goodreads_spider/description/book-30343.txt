When Detective Sergeant Duncan Hatcher is summoned to the home of Judge Cato Laird in the middle of the night to investigate a fatal shooting, he knows discretion and kid-glove treatment will be key to staying in the judge s good graces and keeping his job. It s an open-and-shut case: Elise, the judge s beautiful trophy wife, interrupted a burglary and killed the intruder in self-defense. Yet Duncan is suspicious of the beautiful woman s story of innocence and his gut tells him her account of the shooting is only partially true. Determined to learn the dead man s connection to the Lairds, Duncan investigates further but soon finds his career, and integrity, in jeopardy. Despite his suspicions, Duncan is increasingly drawn to Elise even if she is a married woman, a proven liar, and a murder suspect. When Elise seeks Duncan out privately, he initially dismisses her incredible allegation as the manipulative lie of a guilty woman. But if she s telling the truth, then that single fatal gunshot at her home takes on even more sinister significance, possibly involving Duncan s nemesis, the brutal crime lord Robert Savich. And then Elise goes missing...
