20351509:::::Fallen Fourth Down:::::My mother tried to destroy me. She doesn t exist to me anymore and my father, the one who raised me and the biological one, are both works in progress. The only two people that I can trust are Mason and Logan, and they re the two people who I could lose. It won t happen. I won t let it. No matter the truth, no matter who loves me, I won t let anything or anyone come between us. They re my world. They re my life. They re my family.
