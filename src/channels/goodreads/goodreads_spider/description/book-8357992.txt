8357992:::::Worth Dying For:::::#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Compulsively readable. The Wall Street Journal Don t pick up [this] Jack Reacher novel if you don t have some time on your hands, because Worth Dying For is difficult to put down. . . . Child manages to get an amazing amount of suspense into the novel. Associated Press There s deadly trouble in the corn county of Nebraska . . . and Jack Reacher walks right into it. First he falls foul of the Duncans, a local clan that has terrified an entire county into submission. But it s the unsolved, decades-old case of a missing child that Reacher can t let go. The Duncans want Reacher gone and it s not just past secrets they re trying to hide. For as dangerous as the Duncans are, they re just the bottom of a criminal food chain stretching halfway around the world. For Reacher, it would have made much more sense to put some distance between himself and the hard-core trouble that s bearing down on him. For Reacher, that was also impossible. BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Lee Child's The Affair. A model of suspenseful storytelling and an outstanding addition to a series that stands in the front rank of modern thrillers. The Washington Post Still the thinking man s action hero, supreme butt-kicker and smartest guy in the room. The Seattle Times This series is about as good as pop fiction gets. The Miami Herald
