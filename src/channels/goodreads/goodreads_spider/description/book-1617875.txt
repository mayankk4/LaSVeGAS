From the moment they met in college, best friends Adele Brannon and Kamryn Matika thought nothing could come between them until Adele did the unthinkable and slept with Kamryn s fianc , Nate. Now, after years of silence, the two women are reuniting, and Adele has a stunning request for her old friend: she wants Kamryn to adopt her five-year-old daughter, Tegan. Besides the difference in skin color many will assume that headstrong, impulsive Kamryn is Tegan s nanny there s the inconvenient truth that Kamryn is wholly unprepared to take care of anyone, especially someone who reminds her so much of Nate. With crises brewing at work and her love life in shambles, can Kamryn somehow become the mother a little girl needs her to be?
