Gabe is more than willing to show sweet Melanie there s more to him than meets the eye. All she has to do is try him. Will they only share a single night of passion? Or will their hearts entangle as quickly as their bodies? Contains explicit sex, graphic language, and a hot rock star with a naughty and inventive mind. *** Gabe and Melanie's story continues in Book 6: Tell Me and Book 11: Trust Me (not yet released).
