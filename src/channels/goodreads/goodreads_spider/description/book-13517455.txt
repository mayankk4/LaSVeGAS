13517455:::::Reboot:::::Five years ago, Wren Connolly was shot three times in the chest. After 178 minutes she came back as a Reboot: stronger, faster, able to heal, and less emotional. The longer Reboots are dead, the less human they are when they return. Wren 178 is the deadliest Reboot in the Republic of Texas. Now seventeen years old, she serves as a soldier for HARC (Human Advancement and Repopulation Corporation). Wren s favorite part of the job is training new Reboots, but her latest newbie is the worst she s ever seen. As a 22, Callum Reyes is practically human. His reflexes are too slow, he s always asking questions, and his ever-present smile is freaking her out. Yet there s something about him she can t ignore. When Callum refuses to follow an order, Wren is given one last chance to get him in line or she ll have to eliminate him. Wren has never disobeyed before and knows if she does, she ll be eliminated, too. But she has also never felt as alive as she does around Callum. The perfect soldier is done taking orders.
