17316075:::::Second Chance Boyfriend:::::**Recommended for ages 17+ due to sexual content and language, mature subject matter** New Adult Contemporary Lost. That one single word best describes my life at this very moment. I lost the last games of the season and both my team and my coach blame me. I lost the last two months because I drowned in my own despair like a complete loser. And I lost the only girl who ever mattered because I was afraid being with me would destroy her. But now I realize how truly lost I am without her. She has become my story and even though she acts like she s moved on, I know she still thinks about me just as much as I think about her. She s beautiful, sweet and so damn vulnerable, all I want to do is help her. Be there for her. Love her If only I could convince Fable to give me a second chance. Then I wouldn t feel so lost anymore, and neither would she. We could be found together. Forever.
