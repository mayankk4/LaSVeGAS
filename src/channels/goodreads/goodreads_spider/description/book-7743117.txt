7743117:::::Sacre Bleu: A Comedy d'Art:::::In his latest novel, Moore takes on the Great French Masters. A magnificent Comedy d Art , Sacre Bleu is part mystery, part history (sort of), part love story, and wholly hilarious as it follows a young baker-painter who joins the dapper Henri Toulouse-Lautrec on a quest to unravel the mystery behind the supposed suicide of Vincent van Gogh.
