38030:::::Savannah Blues:::::Meet Weezie (aka Eloise) Foley, a feisty antiques picker, banished by her spiteful ex-husband from the house she herself restored in Savannah s historic district, who must come to terms with a life that has suddenly changed and not, it seems, for the better. In Mary Kay Andrews s delectable New York Times bestseller, Savannah Blues, readers will feel the sultry Georgia breezes and taste sea salt in the air, as they lose themselves in a wonderful, witty tale brimming with sass and peopled by a richly endearing cast of delightfully eccentric characters. Revenge is sweeter than sweet in Mary Kay s capable hands, and readers of Fannie Flagg, Adriana Trigiani, Emily Giffin, Rebecca Wells, and Jill Conner Browne will definitely want to spend some quality time in Savannah.
