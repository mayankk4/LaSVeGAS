After gathering all of the warriors together in a fake award ceremony the witch Elder casts a spell to pull the men s mates to them, whether they want it or not. Aiden is adamant that he doesn t need a mate and that they would only get in the way, little does he realize Fate is sending him his mate first! He meets his destined mate Meryn Evans and things go downhill from there. In the first twenty four hours she kicks, screams and knocks her bear shifting mate unconscious.
