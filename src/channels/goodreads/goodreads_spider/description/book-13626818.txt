13626818:::::Molly's Lips: Club Mephisto Retold:::::When Mephisto s friend Clayton is called out of town on business, he agrees to look after his slave for the week. But Molly isn t your average slave. She and Clayton share a serious, full time dynamic. Mephisto feels a weight of responsibility he isn t used to, and worse, an intense attraction to Molly, the partner of his friend. Mephisto is determined to sublimate his inappropriate desires and provide a challenging and instructive week for the devoted slave. He subjects Molly to orgasm denial, speech restriction, scenes of erotic torment, even an orgy where she is made to service his friends. Along the way, he experiences unfamiliar jealousy, and deep cravings to possess her himself. Throughout the week, he is also haunted by persistent questions. Is she happy being a 24/7 slave? Or is there another Molly trapped beneath her submissive, surrendered gaze? If you've read Club Mephisto, you know this story from Molly's perspective. Now, prepare to relive the experience from Mephisto's point of view... Publisher's Note: this 32K-word erotic novella depicts "total power exchange" relationships that some readers may find objectionable, as well as sado-masochism, objectification, orgasm denial and speech restriction, caging, anal play and double penetration, BDSM punishment and discipline, M/f, M/m/f, M/m, orgy and group sexual encounters, and voyeurism. This is a retelling of the book Club Mephisto from the dominant point of view.
