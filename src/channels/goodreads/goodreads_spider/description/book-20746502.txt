20746502:::::Looking for Alibrandi:::::For as long as Josephine Alibrandi can remember, it s just been her, her mom, and her grandmother. Now it s her final year at a wealthy Catholic high school. The nuns couldn t be any stricter but that doesn t seem to stop all kinds of men from coming into her life. Caught between the old-world values of her Italian grandmother, the nononsense wisdom of her mom, and the boys who continue to mystify her, Josephine is on the ride of her life. This will be the year she falls in love, the year she discovers the secrets of her family s past and the year she sets herself free. Told with unmatched depth and humor, this novel which swept the pool of Australian literary awards and became a major motion picture is one to laugh through and cry with, to cherish and remember.
