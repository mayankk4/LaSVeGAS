93723:::::Boy Meets Girl:::::Meet Kate Mackenzie. She: - works for the T.O.D. (short for Tyrannical Office Despot, also known as Amy Jenkins, Director of the Human Resources Division at the New York Journal) - is sleeping on the couch because her boyfriend of ten years refuses to commit - can't find an affordable studio apartment anywhere in New York City - thinks things can't get any worse. They can. Because: - the T.O.D. is making her fire the most popular employee in the paper's senior staff dining room - that employee is now suing Kate for wrongful termination, and - now Kate has to give a deposition in front of Mitch Hertzog, the scion of one of Manhattan's wealthiest law families,who embraces everything Kate most despises ... but also happens to have a nice smile and a killer bod. The last thing anybody -- least of all Kate Mackenzie -- expects to find in a legal arbitration is love. But that's the kind of thing that can happen when... Boy meets girl.
