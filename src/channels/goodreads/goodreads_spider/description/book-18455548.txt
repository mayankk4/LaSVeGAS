18455548:::::Fashionably Dead:::::Vampyres don t exist. They absolutely do not exist. At least I didn t think they did til I tried to quit smoking and ended up Undead. Who in the hell did I screw over in a former life that my getting healthy equates with dead? Now I m a Vampyre. Yes, we exist whether we want to or not. However, I have to admit, the perks aren t bad. My girls no longer jiggle, my ass is higher than a kite and the latest Prada keeps finding its way to my wardrobe. On the downside, I m stuck with an obscenely profane Guardian Angel who looks like Oprah and a Fairy Fighting Coach who s teaching me to annihilate like the Terminator. To complicate matters, my libido has increased to Vampyric proportions and my attraction to a hotter than Satan s underpants killer rogue Vampyre is not only dangerous . . . it s possibly deadly. For real dead. Permanent death isn t on my agenda. Avoiding him is my only option. Of course, since he thinks I m his, it s easier said than done. Like THAT S not enough to deal with, all the other Vampyres think I m some sort of Chosen One. Holy Hell, if I m in charge of saving an entire race of blood suckers, the Undead are in for one hell of a ride.
