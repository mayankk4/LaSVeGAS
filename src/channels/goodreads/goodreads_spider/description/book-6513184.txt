6513184:::::Kei's Gift:::::Darshian is a vast land, inhabited by a peaceful, rational society where people with extraordinary Gifts are common, and life is lived according to strong ethical principles. Kuprij is made up of a thousand crowded islands thrusting, ambitious, war-like, driven by a booming population and a desire to bring its religion and its laws to the whole world. Twenty years ago, it conquered south Darshian, now it has greedy eyes on the north. The war brings Kei, a gentle, fun-loving healer from an isolated village, into collision with Arman, an embittered, honourable general, a man trapped in a loveless marriage and joylessly wedded to duty. The fate of two nations will rest on these two men and somehow they must not only learn to overcome their own personal difficulties, but bring peace with honour to their countries. If they fail...many innocents will die. Words: 305,966 (approximate)
