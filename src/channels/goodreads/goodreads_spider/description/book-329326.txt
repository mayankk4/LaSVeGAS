329326:::::Observatory Mansions:::::Once the Orme family s magnificent ancestral estate, Observatory Mansions is now a crumbling apartment complex, home to an eccentric group of misfits. One of them is Francis Orme, who earns his livelihood as a living statue. When not practicing inner and outer stillness, Francis steals the cherished possessions of others to add to his private museum. The other tenants are equally as odd: his mother and father, who haven t interacted in years; a man who continually sweats and cries; a recluse who prefers television to reality; and a woman who behaves like a dog. When Anna Tapp arrives among them she stirs their souls, bringing long forgotten memories to the surface and arousing fears that this new resident intends to provoke a metamorphosis.
