Hailed as a classic. . . . humorous, full of warmth and real invention (The New Yorker), this beloved story -first published more than fifty years ago- introduces readers to Milo and his adventures in the Lands Beyond. For Milo, everything s a bore. When a tollbooth mysteriously appears in his room, he drives through only because he s got nothing better to do. But on the other side, things seem different. Milo visits the Island of Conclusions (you get there by jumping), learns about time from a ticking watchdog named Tock, and even embarks on a quest to rescue Rhyme and Reason! Somewhere along the way, Milo realizes something astonishing. Life is far from dull. In fact, it s exciting beyond his wildest dreams. . . .
