7708628:::::Naked:::::No strings. No regrets. And no going back. I didn't think he wanted me. And I wasn't about to get involved with him, not after what I'd heard. Sure, Alex Kennedy was tall, dark and unbearably hot, but I've been burned before. When I solicited him to model for my erotic photography book, I didn't expect such a heated, passionate photo session. And now that we've crossed that line, our bodies aren't the only things that have been exposed. But I can't give my heart to a man who's so unconventional. His last sexual relationship was with a married couple. It's enough that my ex-fianc preferred men, I can't take that chance again no matter how much my body thrives on Alex's touch. I can't risk it, but I can't resist it, either. Alex can be very convincing when he wants something. And he wants me.
