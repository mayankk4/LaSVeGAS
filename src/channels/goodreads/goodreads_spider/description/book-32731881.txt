32731881:::::Rhapsodic:::::Callypso Lillis is a siren with a very big problem, one that stretches up her arm and far into her past. For the last seven years she s been collecting a bracelet of black beads up her wrist, magical IOUs for favors she s received. Only death or repayment will fulfill the obligations. Only then will the beads disappear. Everyone knows that if you need a favor, you go to the Bargainer to make it happen. He s a man who can get you anything you want at a price. And everyone knows that sooner or later he always collects. But for one of his clients, he s never asked for repayment. Not until now. When Callie finds the fae king of the night in her room, a grin on his lips and a twinkle in his eye, she knows things are about to change. At first it s just a chaste kiss a single bead s worth and a promise for more. For the Bargainer, it s more than just a matter of rekindling an old romance. Something is happening in the Otherworld. Fae warriors are going missing one by one. Only the women are returned, each in a glass casket, a child clutched to their breast. And then there are the whispers among the slaves, whispers of an evil that s been awoken. If the Bargainer has any hope to save his people, he ll need the help of the siren he spurned long ago. Only, his foe has a taste for exotic creatures, and Callie just happens to be one.
