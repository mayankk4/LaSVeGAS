Now, all Trynne can imagine is the roar of flames, the cries of Gahalatine s people, and the smell of cinders in a city gone dark.

Saboteur, conspirator, and full-blood sister of the king, she is prepared to set forth a wave of destruction that will eliminate everything that stands between her and possession of the throne. But Trynne has her weapons, too her magic, her resilience, her skills at intrigue, and especially, Fallon. The man who once swore his allegiance to Morwenna now stands by Trynne s side as they venture into the unknown to protect those they love, reunite with a family scattered by diabolical forces, and safeguard a kingdom as well as the destiny the Fountain has for each of them.
