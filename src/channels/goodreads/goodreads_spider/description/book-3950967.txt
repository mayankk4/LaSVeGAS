3950967:::::The Tales of Beedle the Bard:::::The Tales of Beedle the Bard , a Wizarding classic, first came to Muggle readers attention in the book known as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows . Now, thanks to Hermione Granger s new translation from the ancient runes, we present this stunning edition with an introduction, notes, and illustrations by J. K. Rowling, and extensive commentary by Albus Dumbledore. Never before have Muggles been privy to these richly imaginative tales: The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, The Fountain of Fair Fortune, The Warlock s Hairy Heart, Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump, and of course, The Tale of the Three Brothers. But not only are they the equal of fairy tales we now know and love, reading them gives new insight into the world of Harry Potter.
