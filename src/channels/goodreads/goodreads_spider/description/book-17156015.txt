17156015:::::Beauty from Pain:::::They agreed on three months...but their love knew no boundaries. Jack McLachlan is a winemaking magnate and easily one of Australia s most eligible bachelors. His success and wealth make him no stranger to the complications of romantic relationships and that s why he goes to extreme measures to avoid the hassle. He prefers simplicity in the form of a beautiful female companion with no strings attached. He arranges relationships like business deals and they re always the same. No long term relationships. No real names. It s his game and his rules. He s content to play as usual, but when Laurelyn Prescott enters his life, his strategy must change because this player is like none he's ever encountered. His world is turned on its head after he begins a three month affair with the beautiful American musician. Nothing goes according to plan and as he breaks more and more of his own rules for her, she s exceptionally close to becoming something he never thought possible. His ultimate game changer. Not recommended for younger readers due to sexual content and language.
