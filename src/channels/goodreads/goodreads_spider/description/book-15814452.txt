15814452:::::The Center of Everything:::::Spring 2013 Kids' Indie Next List For Ruby Pepperdine, the center of everything is on the rooftop of Pepperdine Motors in her donut-obsessed town of Bunning, New Hampshire, stargazing from the circle of her grandmother Gigi s hug. That s how everything is supposed to be until Ruby messes up and things spin out of control. But she has one last hope. It all depends on what happens on Bunning Day, when the entire town will hear Ruby read her winning essay. And it depends on her twelfth birthday wish unless she messes that up too. Can Ruby s wish set everything straight in her topsy-turvy world?
