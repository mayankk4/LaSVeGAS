32933947:::::Noteworthy:::::It s the start of Jordan Sun s junior year at the Kensington-Blaine Boarding School for the Performing Arts. Unfortunately, she s an Alto 2, which in the musical theatre world is sort of like being a vulture in the wild: She has a spot in the ecosystem, but nobody s falling over themselves to express their appreciation. So it s no surprise when she gets shut out of the fall musical for the third year straight. Then the school gets a mass email: A spot has opened up in the Sharpshooters, Kensington s elite a cappella octet. Worshiped ... revered ... all male. Desperate to prove herself, Jordan auditions in her most convincing drag, and it turns out that Jordan Sun, Tenor 1, is exactly what the Sharps are looking for.
