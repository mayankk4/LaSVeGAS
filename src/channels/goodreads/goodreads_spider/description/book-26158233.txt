26158233:::::Aideen:::::Aideen Collins is fed up. She is at her wits end with her eon long pregnancy, her new-found paranoia, but mostly she is fed up with her boyfriend s constant hovering and nit-picking. Kane Slater is happier than ever. He is about to become a father for the first time with the woman he loves. Little does he know that Aideen is both literally and figuratively a ticking time bomb. He just has to survive a few more weeks of murderous hormonal outbursts, and all will be well or so he hopes. They re both caught up with the expected arrival of their little one, but in the back of their minds is a shadow that won t fade away. Neither of them talk about it, but the shadow s lingering presence casts doubt over their relationship. Big Phil worked his way into their minds many weeks ago and rooted himself as the haunting figure. Without even trying, he ruins things and causes problems. He watches them from afar, hoping he can break their family. Aideen s instincts to protect her own are stronger than ever. If Big Phil wants to hurt those dearest to her, he is going to have one hell of a fight on his hands. Aideen worships Kane, and what Aideen worships, Aideen shelters.
