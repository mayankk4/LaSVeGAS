17133266:::::What The Torah Teaches Us About Life / Through The Themes Of The Weekly Torah Portions:::::Pirkei Avot 2:6 "...Delve into it (the Torah) for everything is in it..." It is a tree of life for those who hold fast to it, and all of its supporters are happy! Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace. Of the many different ways to study the Torah, doing so through the themes of the parshiyot is brilliant, refreshing, and unique. The combination of scholarship, spirituality, humor, current events, and history are woven together seamlessly in this book. What The Torah Teaches Us About Life, is both easy to read for the average person, and yet manages to eloquently provide profound and novel insights. Laura Weakley makes studying the Torah interesting, fun, and relevant to anyone with even the slightest interest in the Five Books of Moses. This may be her best book yet! Well worth the wait, and timely to boot! -- K.A. Weakley
