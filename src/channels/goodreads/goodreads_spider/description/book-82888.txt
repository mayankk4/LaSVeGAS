82888:::::Dom Casmurro:::::A classic story of love and jealousy, Dom Casmurro is the story of Bento and his childhood love, Capitu, who overcome their parents' reluctance to marry. But Bento jealously suspects that their son is not his. But beyond this straightforward plot, Machado plays with the reader's expectations and comments on the structure of the story, blurring the line between fiction and reality and appearing very modern.
