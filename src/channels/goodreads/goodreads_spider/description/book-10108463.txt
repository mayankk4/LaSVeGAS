10108463:::::The Devil All the Time:::::From the acclaimed author of Knockemstiff called powerful, remarkable, exceptional by the Los Angeles Times comes a dark and riveting vision of America that delivers literary excitement in the highest degree. In The Devil All the Time , Donald Ray Pollock has written a novel that marries the twisted intensity of Oliver Stone s Natural Born Killers with the religious and Gothic over tones of Flannery O Connor at her most haunting. Set in rural southern Ohio and West Virginia, The Devil All the Time follows a cast of compelling and bizarre characters from the end of World War II to the 1960s. There s Willard Russell, tormented veteran of the carnage in the South Pacific, who can t save his beautiful wife, Charlotte, from an agonizing death by cancer no matter how much sacrifi cial blood he pours on his prayer log. There s Carl and Sandy Henderson, a husband-and-wife team of serial kill ers, who troll America s highways searching for suitable models to photograph and exterminate. There s the spider-handling preacher Roy and his crippled virtuoso-guitar-playing sidekick, Theodore, running from the law. And caught in the middle of all this is Arvin Eugene Russell, Willard and Charlotte s orphaned son, who grows up to be a good but also violent man in his own right. Donald Ray Pollock braids his plotlines into a taut narrative that will leave readers astonished and deeply moved. With his first novel, he proves himself a master storyteller in the grittiest and most uncompromising American grain.
