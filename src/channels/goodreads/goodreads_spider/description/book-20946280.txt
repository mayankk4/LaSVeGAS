20946280:::::Papap's Teeth:::::Sara has a grandfather who has a rather odd obsession. Every time she sees him, he pulls a small wooden box out of his pocket, stares at it for a moment, then puts it back. It isn t something he forgets to do- more like compelled. One day, Sara is left with her grandfather while her parents go on a business trip. The box is nowhere to be seen until Sara gets ready for bed. The box is on the nightstand. Her curiosity is too much for her. What is inside the box will change her life forever.
