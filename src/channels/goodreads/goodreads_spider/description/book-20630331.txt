20630331:::::Finding Dandelion:::::When soccer all-star Jax Avery collides with Dani Hart on his twenty-first birthday, their connection is instantaneous and explosive. For the first time in years, Jax isn t interested in his usual hit-it and quit-it approach. But Dani knows better. Allowing herself a night to be carefree and feel the intensity of their attraction won t change anything when it comes to dealing with a player. So when Jax doesn t recognize Dani the next time he sees her, it shouldn t be a total shock. The fact that he s her new roommate's brother? That s a shock. Dani doesn t regret that night with Jax, just the need to lie about it. Since her roommate has made it clear what she thinks about her brother s type of girl, the last thing Dani wants is to admit what happened. Jax knows he s walking a fine line on the soccer team. One more misstep and he s off the roster, his plans to go pro be damned. Except he can t seem to care. About anything except for the one girl who keeps invading his dreams. Despite Jax s fuzzy memory of his hot hookup with his sister s friend, he can t stay away from her, even if it means breaking his own rules. But there are bigger forces at work realities that can end Dani s college career and lies that can tear them apart. Jax realizes what he s losing if Dani walks away, but will he sacrifice his future to be with her? And will she let him if he does?
