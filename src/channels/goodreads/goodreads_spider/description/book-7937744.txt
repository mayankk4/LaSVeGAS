7937744:::::Surface Detail:::::It begins in the realm of the Real, where matter still matters. It begins with a murder. It will not end until the Culture has gone to war with death itself. Lededje Y'breq is one of the Intagliated, her marked body bearing witness to a family shame, her life belonging to a man whose lust for power is without limit. Prepared to risk everything for her freedom, her release, when it comes, is at a price. To put things right she will need the help of the Culture. Benevolent, enlightened &amp; almost infinitely resourceful tho it may be, the Culture can only do so much for any individual. With the assistance of one of its most powerful --- &amp; arguably deranged --- warships, Lededje finds herself heading into a combat zone not even sure which side the Culture is really on. A brutal, far-reaching war is already raging within the digital realms that store the souls of the dead &amp; it's about to erupt into reality. It started in the realm of the Real &amp; that is where it will end. It will touch countless lives &amp; affect entire civilizations, but at the center of it all is a young woman whose need for revenge masks another motive altogether.
