1588709:::::Here Kitty, Kitty!:::::What do you do when you ve got a hillbilly tiger by the tail? Or maybe the question should be: what wouldn t you do Nikolai Vorislav likes his single life just as it is. Simple, relaxing and quiet. What he doesn t need is some foul-mouthed Texan hellcat living in his house, eating his food, flirting with his idiot brothers and shooting holes in his home with his granddaddy s gun. But those long legs, dark eyes and lethal tongue are making Nik insane and he fears he may be caught in the sexiest animal trap ever. Angelina Santiago doesn t know how she got from Texas to North Carolina in a night or how she ended up in some hillbilly tiger s house wearing only a sheet. What she does know is that she doesn t like good ol boys with slow, sexy drawls who can t seem to stop rubbing up against her. Yet in order to protect her friends, Angie has to stay with a cat who seems hellbent on finding all sorts of delicious ways to make her purr.
