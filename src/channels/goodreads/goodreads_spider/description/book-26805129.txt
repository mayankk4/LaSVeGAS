26805129:::::Perfectly Imperfect:::::Mirror, mirror who s the fairest of them all? I still cringe when I hear that line. A fairy tale that had girls pretending they were the fairest, the most beautiful, and the most entitled. A fairy tale most couldn t grow out of turned my haunted childhood memories into a living nightmare. Girls who grew up believing that pile of garbage became the meanest of all mean girls. And those mean girls were right it was a line meant for all the beautiful people in the world and I knew the answer would never be me . The women with long legs, flat stomachs, and perfect chests. The type of women Kane Masters gravitated toward. Well, that s definitely not Willow Tate. No. That will never be me. Because I m completely imperfect. And I hate myself. I have no idea what Kane could possibly see in someone like me when he could have them .
