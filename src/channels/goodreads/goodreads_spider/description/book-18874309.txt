18874309:::::Incendiary:::::WINNER OF THE 2013 UTOPYA AWARDS FOR BEST VILLAIN &amp; BEST BOOK COVER OF THE YEAR Cold, fine drops of rain fall softly on my cheeks as I emerge from the darkness of the ship s interior to the gray, overcast sky of the main deck. Pulling my dark pea coat tighter to my body, the wind lifts red tendrils of my hair. I walk slowly to the railing overlooking the water. I catch my first sight of the Irish coastline; its craggy landscape makes me shiver in dread. I find it difficult to imagine now how the Gancanagh had made this their home for so long without anyone realizing it. The cold, moss-covered edifices practically scream their presence. As I study the shadows between the falling-down stone, I imagine creeping shapes of undead Faeries grasping the rock, waiting for our ship to draw nearer to their position. Tipping my face up, I let the rain wash over me. It bathes away the frigid sweat of fear that has broken on my brow. You don t know how fiercely beautiful you are, do you? A quiet voice behind me asks, causing me to stiffen and fix my eyes on the rocks along the shoreline.
