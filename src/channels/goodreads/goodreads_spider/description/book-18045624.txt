18045624:::::Scorched:::::Sometimes life leaves a mark. Most days, Andrea doesn t know whether she wants to kiss Tanner or punch him in the gut. He is seriously hot, with legit bedroom eyes and that firefighter body of his, but he s a major player, and they can t get along for more than a handful of minutes. Until now. Tanner knows he and Andrea have had an epic love/hate relationship for as long as he can remember, but he wants more love than hate from her. He wants her . Now. Tomorrow. But the more he gets to know her, the more it becomes obvious that Andrea has a problem. She s teetering on the edge, and every time he tries to catch her, she slips through his fingers. Andrea s life is spiraling out of control, and it doesn t matter that Tanner wants to save her, because when everything falls apart and she s speeding toward rock bottom, only she can save herself. Sometimes life makes you work for that happily ever after
