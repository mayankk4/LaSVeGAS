17927559:::::Fighting Destiny:::::Have you ever heard of the old Celtic legends of the Fae beautiful, magical, and deadly creatures that have a love of messing with humans just for kicks and giggles? Welcome to my world. What started out as a strange assignment, lead to one of the most gruesome murder mysteries of our times. My friends and I are set and determined to find out who is killing off Fae and Witches alike. Couple of problems in the way I hate the Fae and the Prince of the Dark Fae is bound and determined that I work for him. He s a rude, overbearing egotistical ass with a compulsive need to possess, dominate and control me. Oh did I mention that he is absolutely sex-on-a-stick gorgeous and he makes me feel things that I never ever wanted to feel for a Fae... every time he touches me or looks at me with those dangerous golden eyes he seems to pull me further in under his spell, despite my better judgment. My friends and I can t trust anyone and nothing is as it seems on the surface not even me.
