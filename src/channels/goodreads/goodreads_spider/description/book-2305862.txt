2305862:::::Havemercy:::::This stunning epic fantasy debut introduces two exciting new authors and a world brimming with natural and man-made wonders, extraordinary events, and a crisis that will test the mettle of men, the boundaries of magic, and the heart and soul of a kingdom. Thanks to its elite Dragon Corps, the capital city of Volstov has all but won the hundred years war with its neighboring enemy, the Ke-Han. The renegade airmen who fly the corps s mechanical, magic-fueled dragons are Volstov s greatest weapon. But now one of its members is at the center of a scandal that may turn the tide of victory. To counter the threat, four ill-assorted heroes must converge to save their kingdom: an exiled magician, a naive country boy, a young student and the unpredictable ace who flies the city s fiercest dragon, Havemercy. But on the eve of battle, these courageous men will face something that could make the most formidable of warriors hesitate, the most powerful of magicians weak, and the most unlikely of men allies in their quest to rise against it.
