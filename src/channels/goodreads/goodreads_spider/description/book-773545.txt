773545:::::Wraith Squadron:::::They are the galaxy s most elite fighting force. And as the battle against the Empire rages, the X-wing fighters risk life and machine to protect the Rebel Alliance. Now they must go on a daring undercover mission as the crew of an Imperial warship. It is Wedge Antilles boldest creation: a covert-action unit of X-wing fighters, its pilots drawn from the dregs of other units, castoffs and rejects given one last chance. But before the new pilots can complete their training, the squadron s base is attacked by former Imperial Admiral Trigit, and Wraith Squadron is forced to swing into action taking over an Imperial warship and impersonating its crew. The mission: to gain vital intelligence about Trigit s secret weapons, to sabotage the admiral s plans, and to lure him into an Alliance trap. But the high-stakes gamble pits Wraith Squadron s ragtag renegades against the Empire s most brilliant master of guile and deception. Are they up to the challenge? If not, the penalty is instant death.
