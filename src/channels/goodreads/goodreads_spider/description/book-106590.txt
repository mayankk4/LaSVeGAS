106590:::::Lincoln:::::A masterful work by Pulitzer Prize winning author David Herbert Donald, Lincoln is a stunning portrait of Abraham Lincoln s life and presidency. Donald brilliantly depicts Lincoln s gradual ascent from humble beginnings in rural Kentucky to the ever-expanding political circles in Illinois, and finally to the presidency of a country divided by civil war. Donald goes beyond biography, illuminating the gradual development of Lincoln s character, chronicling his tremendous capacity for evolution and growth, thus illustrating what made it possible for a man so inexperienced and so unprepared for the presidency to become a great moral leader. In the most troubled of times, here was a man who led the country out of slavery and preserved a shattered Union in short, one of the greatest presidents this country has ever seen.
