19395578:::::The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry:::::Hanging over the porch of the tiny New England bookstore called Island Books is a faded sign with the motto No Man Is an Island; Every Book Is a World. A.J. Fikry, the irascible owner, is about to discover just what that truly means. A.J. Fikry s life is not at all what he expected it to be. His wife has died, his bookstore is experiencing the worst sales in its history, and now his prized possession, a rare collection of Poe poems, has been stolen. Even the books in his store have stopped holding pleasure for him. These days, A.J. can only see them as a sign of a world that is changing too rapidly. And then a mysterious package appears at the bookstore. It s a small package, but large in weight. It s that unexpected arrival that gives A.J. the opportunity to make his life over, the ability to see everything anew. It doesn t take long for the locals to notice the change overcoming him or for a determined sales rep named Amelia to see her curmudgeonly client in a new light. The wisdom of all those books again become the lifeblood of A.J. s world and everything twists into a version of his life that he didn t see coming. As surprising as it is moving, The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry is an unforgettable tale of transformation and second chances, an irresistible affirmation of why we read and why we love.
