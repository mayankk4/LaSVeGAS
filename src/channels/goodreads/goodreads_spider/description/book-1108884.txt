Seething with decadent appetites unchecked by law or gods, the court of Antyre is ruled by the last of a dissolute aristocracy. But now to the kingdom comes a handsome, enigmatic nobleman, Maledicte, whose perfect manners, enchanting charisma, and brilliant swordplay entice the most jaded tastes . . . and conceal a hunger beyond reckoning. For Maledicte is actually a woman named Miranda a beautiful thief raised in the city s vicious slums. And she will do anything even promise her soul to Black-Winged Ani, the most merciless of Antyre s exiled gods to reclaim Janus, the lover whose passion still haunts her dreams. As her machinations strike at the heart of Antyre s powerful noble houses, Miranda must battle not only her own growing bloodlust, but also her lover s newly kindled and ruthless ambitions. As Ani s force grows insatiable and out of control, Miranda has no choice but to wield a weapon that may set her free . . . or forever doom her and everything she holds dear.
