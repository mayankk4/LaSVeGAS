36195139:::::The Fortunate Ones:::::At Twin Oaks Country Club, there are the fortunate ones, and then there are the rest of us: the waiters, the caddies, the valets, and in my case, the cabana girls. Most days, I m poolside in a pleated skirt, dishing out margaritas to tycoons and titans. It s not exactly my dream job, but it does come with one perk James Ashwood. He s my silver lining in a custom black suit. Besides being a legacy member at the club, he s a tech mogul and Austin s most eligible bachelor. Oh, and those dimples? Yeah , they make my stomach dip too. On good days, I catch his sleek Porsche winding down the tree-lined drive. On better days, I steal a glimpse of his handsome profile as we pass in the hall. And on the absolute best day, I find him alone at the bar, looking for company. Come have a seat. Those four little words set me down a path I never could have imagined. Private planes, penthouse suites, and temptations around every corner make it impossible to keep my distance. His world feels decadent and wild but overindulgence comes with a cost. Every kiss comes with strings. Every erotic encounter is a promise I m not ready to keep. When I pump the brakes, he hits the gas. James doesn t want to go slow he wants a commitment. And the thing about the fortunate ones? They re used to getting what they want.
