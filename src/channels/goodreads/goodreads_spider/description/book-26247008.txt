26247008:::::Truly Madly Guilty:::::Six responsible adults. Three cute kids. One small dog. It s just a normal weekend. What could possibly go wrong? Sam and Clementine have a wonderful, albeit, busy life: they have two little girls, Sam has just started a new dream job, and Clementine, a cellist, is busy preparing for the audition of a lifetime. If there s anything they can count on, it s each other. Clementine and Erika are each other s oldest friends. A single look between them can convey an entire conversation. But theirs is a complicated relationship, so when Erika mentions a last minute invitation to a barbecue with her neighbors, Tiffany and Vid, Clementine and Sam don t hesitate. Having Tiffany and Vid s larger than life personalities there will be a welcome respite. Two months later, it won t stop raining, and Clementine and Sam can t stop asking themselves the question: What if we hadn t gone? In Truly Madly Guilty, Liane Moriarty takes on the foundations of our lives: marriage, sex, parenthood, and friendship. She shows how guilt can expose the fault lines in the most seemingly strong relationships, how what we don t say can be more powerful than what we do, and how sometimes it is the most innocent of moments that can do the greatest harm.
