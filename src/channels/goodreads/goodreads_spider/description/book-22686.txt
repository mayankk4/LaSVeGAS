22686:::::The Other Woman:::::Newly engaged, Ellie is thrilled to be accepted into the loving Cooper clan which seems like the perfect family she never had until she begins to realize that Dan s mom, Linda, is a little too involved. Dan and Linda talk on the phone every day. Twice a day. As Dan and Ellie s intimate civil wedding ceremony gets transformed into a black-tie affair, Ellie begins to wonder if it s possible to marry the man without marrying his mother. As troubles mount, Ellie turns to her friends glamorous Lisa, who always looks like she s just stepped off a runway, and wonderfully frazzled Trish and tries to rediscover the independence she once had, and the man she still loves. But it seems that having a child and saving a marriage means growing up in ways she d never imagined . . . A warm, witty, and wise look at mothers-in-law and what they teach us about ourselves, The Other Woman is sure to please Jane Green s growing legion of fans.
