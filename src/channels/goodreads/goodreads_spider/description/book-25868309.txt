There was no need to open old wounds when she had the life she d worked hard for in Denver. But when she s fired from her awesome job in Colorado and her father dies, she has no choice but to return home to run the derelict bar left to her in the heart of the French Quarter. Callie must not only face bad memories but turn The Odyssey into something she can be proud of. And who better to help bring in crowds of people than Declan Boudreaux? Declan is a sought-after musician who knows he s good at what he does and loves doing it. Known to pack the house, he also loves women and doesn t expect to be knocked back a step by the beautiful new owner of The Odyssey. Callie is sharp, gorgeous and funny, and makes him yearn for something he never has before Commitment. But when Callie s able to turn the business around with renovations, making it one of the hottest bars in the Quarter, will she sell out and leave her past behind once and for all, or will Declan be able to convince her that s she s where she needed to be all along in his arms.
