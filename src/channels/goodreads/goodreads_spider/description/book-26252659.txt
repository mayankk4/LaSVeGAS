Looks, brains, my own money, and a big c*&amp;k. You might think I'm an a*&amp;hole. I sound like one, don t I? I'm hot as sin, rich as heaven, smart as hell and hung like a horse. Guess what? You haven't heard my story before. Sure, I might be a playboy, like the NY gossip rags call me. But I m the playboy who s actually a great guy. Which makes me one of a kind. The only trouble is, my dad needs me to cool it for a bit. With conservative investors in town wanting to buy his flagship Fifth Avenue jewelry store, he needs me not only to zip it up, but to look the part of the committed guy. Fine. I can do this for Dad. After all, I ve got him to thank for the family jewels. So I ask my best friend and business partner to be my fianc e for the next week. Charlotte s up for it. She has her own reasons for saying yes to wearing this big rock. And pretty soon all this playing pretend in public leads to no pretending whatsoever in the bedroom, because she just can t fake the kind of toe-curling, window-shattering orgasmic cries she makes as I take her to new heights between the sheets. But I can t seem to fake that I might be feeling something real for her. What the fuck have I gotten myself into with this big rock? BIG ROCK is a standalone, dirty romance novel written from the guy s POV by NYT Bestselling author Lauren Blakely
