15513156:::::Of Triton:::::Emma has just learned that her mother is a long-lost Poseidon princess, and now struggles with an identity crisis: As a Half-Breed, she s a freak in the human world and an abomination in the Syrena realm below. Syrena law states that all Half-Breeds should be put to death. As if that s not bad enough, her mother s reappearance among the Syrena turns the two kingdoms Poseidon and Triton against one another. Which leaves Emma with a decision to make: Should she comply with Galen s request to keep herself safe and just hope for the best? Or should she risk it all and reveal herself and her Gift to save a people she s never known? Once again, Anna Banks infuses Emma and Galen's points of view with humor, intrigue, and waves of romance.
