A classically trained musician gone rogue, Lindsey Stirling is the epitome of independent, millennial-defined success: after being voted off the set of America s Got Talent , she went on to amass more than ten million social media fans, record two full-length albums, release multiple hits with billions of YouTube views, and tour sold-out venues across the world. Lindsey is not afraid to be herself. In fact, it s her confidence and individuality that have propelled her into the spotlight. But the road hasn t been easy. After being rejected by talent scouts, music reps, and eventually national television, Lindsey forged her own path, step by step. Here, for the first time, she shares every triumph and trial she has faced until now. Beginning in a humble yet charmed childhood, this book follows Lindsey through a humorous adolescence, to her life as a struggling musician, through her personal struggles with anorexia, and finally all the way to her success as a world-class entertainer. Lindsey s magnetizing story is at once remarkable and universal a testimony that there is no singular recipe for success. And a witness that, despite what people may say, sometimes it s okay to be The Only Pirate at the Party .
