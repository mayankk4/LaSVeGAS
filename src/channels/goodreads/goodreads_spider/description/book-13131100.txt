13131100:::::Preservation:::::Fear is sabotage s sweetest weapon. Kate has no time for meaningless romantic charades, and definitely no time for hot college professors who are full of themselves and smitten with her. Constantly battling eviction notices, tuition she can t afford, and a sick, dependent mother, the last thing she needs is to be distracted with someone else s complicated baggage. When she stumbles into Ryan Campbell s creative writing class, he is only Mr. Campbell to her, until Ryan finds himself captivated by her writing and she is forced to face their mutual attraction. His cocky know-it-all syndrome is enough to send her running in the other direction, and his posse of female admirers and playboy reputation are enough to squander any odds in her favor. But underneath Ryan s abrasive facade is something to behold, and she can t stay away for long. Ryan and Kate must decide who they re willing to become and fight against their former selves if they want to make things work. That s if academia, vicious vixens, old skeletons, and their own mastery at self-destruction don t pummel their efforts first.
