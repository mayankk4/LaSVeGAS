19821:::::Riddle-Master:::::For over twenty years, Patricia A. McKillip has captured the hearts and imaginations of thousands of readers. And although her renowned Riddle-Master trilogy-- The Riddle-Master of Hed, Heir of Sea and Fire , and Harpist in the Wind --has been long out of print, it is considered her most enduring and beloved work.
