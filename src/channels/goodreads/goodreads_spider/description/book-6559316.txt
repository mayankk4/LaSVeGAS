6559316:::::Bite Me:::::Christopher Moore is a very sick man, in the very best sense of the word. Carl Hiaasen The undead rise again in Bite Me, the third book in New York Times bestselling author Christopher Moore s wonderfully twisted vampire saga. Joining his farcical gems Bloodsucking Fiends and You Suck, Moore s latest in continuing story of young, urban, nosferatu style love, is no Twilight but rather a tsunami of the irresistible outrageousness that has earned him the appellation, Stephen King with a whoopee cushion and a double-espresso imagination from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and inspired Denver s Rocky Mountain News to declare him, the 21st century s best satirist.
