Along with her brooding elven prince Talivar and sexy incubus Brystion, Abby ventures to the CrossRoads in an attempt to override the Queen s magic. But nothing in this beautiful, dangerous realm will compare to the discoveries she s making about her past, her destiny, and what she will sacrifice for those she loves.
