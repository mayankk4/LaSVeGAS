24892572:::::Love at First Plight:::::There is more than one perspective to every story. On Qarradune, it takes two points of view to make sense of the world. What you know depends on whose story you are following. Megan: My life went from ordinary to extraordinary in the blink of an eye. I didn t know where I was or how I got there. I didn t know if I would ever see my home or the people that I loved, again. All I did know was that I had to save her. Irys: Beaten, unwashed, and starving, I was alone, imprisoned, and enslaved. I didn t want to die, but I was ready. At least, I thought I was. Someone entered my life and tipped the world over. My beautiful bubble had burst, but the reality that came next was astounding. Love at First Plight is the debut novel of Amanda Giasson and Julie B. Campbell, and is also the first volume in the Perspective book series.
