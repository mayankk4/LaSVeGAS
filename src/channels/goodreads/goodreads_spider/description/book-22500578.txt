Given the opportunity to get back in the game by writing a patriotic human interest piece, Savannah turns her attention to the town hermit, Asher Lee, a wounded veteran who returned to Danvers eight years ago, and hasn t been seen since. After an IED explosion in Afghanistan took Asher s hand and disfigured half of his face, he's lived a quiet life on the outskirts of Danvers where the locals respect his privacy that is, until Savannah Carmichael comes calling in a borrowed sundress with a plate of homemade brownies. When Asher agrees to be interviewed by Savannah, he starts feeling things for the beautiful reporter that he hasn t felt in years. Misfits in small-town Danvers, Savannah and Asher create a bond right away, touching each other s hearts in ways neither thought possible. When a terrible mistake threatens to drive them apart, they ll have to decide if the love they found in one another s arms is strong enough to fight for their hard-won happily ever after. ***** The Vixen and the Vet is part of the a modern fairytale collection, which will include five standalone novels: The Vixen and the Vet (Beauty &amp; the Beast) - available now Never Let You Go (Hansel &amp; Gretel) - available now Ginger's Heart (Little Red Riding Hood) - available March 22, 2016 Don't Speak (The Little Mermaid) - available 2017 Swan Song (The Ugly Duckling) available 2017/18 Librarian's Note: This is an alternate/new cover for ASIN B00L19SVQ4
