1981412:::::Macario:::::Macario is the story of a poor man who has been hungry all his life. He suffers from a gnawing poverty which never quite kills, but also never quite permits any visible change or hope. Despite his acceptance of his colorless existence, he has a fantasy which becomes a tacit means of survival, nourishing him far more than does his meager daily diet. This book is #34 in the Cervantes &amp; Co. Spanish Classics series.
