205057:::::Secret Society Girl:::::Fans of Beautiful Disaster will devour Diana Peterfreund's Ivy League novels-- Secret Society Girl, Under the Rose, Rites of Spring (Break), and Tap &amp; Gown . At an elite university, Amy Haskel has been initiated into the country's most notorious secret society. But in this power-hungry world where new blood is at the mercy of old money, hooking up with the wrong people could be fatal. Eli University junior Amy Haskel never expected to be tapped into Rose &amp; Grave. She isn't rich, politically connected, or . . . well, male. So when Amy is one of the first female students to receive the distinctive black-lined invitation with the Rose &amp; Grave seal, she's blown away. Could they really mean her? Whisked off into an elaborate initiation rite, Amy awakens the next day to a new reality and a whole new set of "friends"--from the gorgeous son of a conservative governor to an Afrocentric lesbian activist whose society name is Thorndike. And that's when Amy starts to discover the truth about getting what you wish for. Because Rose &amp; Grave is quickly taking her away from her familiar world of classes and keggers, fueling a feud and undermining a very promising friendship with benefits. And that's before Amy finds out that her first duty as a member of Rose &amp; Grave is to take on a conspiracy of money and power that could, quite possibly, ruin her whole life. From the Hardcover edition.
