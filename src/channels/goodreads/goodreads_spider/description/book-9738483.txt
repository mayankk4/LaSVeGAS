9738483:::::Archangel's Storm:::::With wings of midnight and an affinity for shadows, Jason courts darkness. But now, with the Archangel Neha s consort lying murdered in the jewel-studded palace that was his prison and her rage threatening cataclysmic devastation, Jason steps into the light, knowing he must unearth the murderer before it is too late. Earning Neha s trust comes at a price Jason must tie himself to her bloodline through the Princess Mahiya, a woman with secrets so dangerous, she trusts no one. Least of all an enemy spymaster. With only their relentless hunt for a violent, intelligent killer to unite them, Jason and Mahiya embark on a quest that leads to a centuries-old nightmare and to the dark storm of an unexpected passion that threatens to drench them both in blood.
