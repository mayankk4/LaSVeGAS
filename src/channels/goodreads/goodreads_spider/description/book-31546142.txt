31546142:::::Branding the Virgin:::::Mary-Jane wasn t looking for drama. All she wanted was a family of her own, so she decided to make that happen. A mix-up at the sperm bank leaves her with a baby in her belly, but the father is none the wiser. Ty was injured in a bull-riding accident, and now all he plans on doing is working on his ranch and keeping to himself. That is, until a little dark-haired woman shows up on his doorstep. When their paths cross, will Mary-Jane be able to reveal to Ty that he s the father? Will Ty be able to keep Mary-Jane from running? Will there be a lot of steam in this book? You betcha! Warning: This pregnant virgin story is wonderfully ridiculous and just as sweet as it sounds. Saddle up and take an evening stroll with this easy quickie.
