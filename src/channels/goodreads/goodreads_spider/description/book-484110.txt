484110:::::Phantom Lady:::::Phantom lady, I was with you for six hours last night, but I can't remember what you look like, or what you wore -- except for that large orange hat. We sat shoulder to shoulder at a little bar in the east Fifties. We ate dinner together, saw a Broadway show together, shared a cab together. The bartender, the waiter, the usher, the cab driver -- none of them remembers you. The police say I was home strangling my wife at the moment I met you. You are the only one who can prove my story -- but I don't know your name, or where you live. And I can't search for you from a jail cell....
