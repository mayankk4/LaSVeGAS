31818:::::The Philosophy of Andy Warhol:::::A loosely formed autobiography by Andy Warhol, told with his trademark blend of irony and detachment In The Philosophy of Andy Warhol which, with the subtitle "(From A to B and Back Again)," is less a memoir than a collection of riffs and reflections he talks about love, sex, food, beauty, fame, work, money, and success; about New York, America, and his childhood in McKeesport, Pennsylvania; about his good times and bad in New York, the explosion of his career in the sixties, and his life among celebrities.
