In this latest installment in the internationally best-selling, universally beloved series, there is considerable excitement at The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency. A cobra has been found in Precious Ramotswe s office. Then a nurse from a local medical clinic reveals that faulty blood pressure readings are being recorded there. And Botswana has a new advice columnist, Aunty Emang, whose advice is rather curt for Mma Ramotswe s taste. All this means a lot of work for our heroine and her inestimable assistant, Grace Makutsi, and they are, of course, up to the challenge. But there s trouble brewing in Mma Makutsi s own life. When Phuti Radiphuti misses their customary dinner date, she begins to wonder if he is having second thoughts about their engagement. And while Mma Makutsi may be able to buy that fashionably narrow (and uncomfortable) pair of blue shoes, it may not buy her the happiness that Mma Ramotswe promises her she ll find in the simpler things in contentment with the world and enough tea to smooth over the occasional bumps in the road.
