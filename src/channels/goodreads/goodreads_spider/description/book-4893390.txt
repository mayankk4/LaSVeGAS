4893390:::::The Faceless Ones:::::The third bone-breaking, belly-busting adventure in the series that puts the funny back in, um, funny series. That didn t really work, did it? If you ve read the previous Skulduggery books then you know what the Faceless Ones are and if you know what the Faceless Ones are, then you can probably take a wild guess that things in this book are going to get AWFULLY sticky for our skeletal hero and his young sidekick. If you haven t read the previous Skulduggery books then what are you doing reading this? Go and read them right now, so that you know what all that stuff in the previous paragraph was about. Done? Good. So now you re on tenterhooks too, desperately awaiting the answers to all your questions, and instead you re going to have to wait to read the book. Sorry about that.
