4447622:::::Some Girls Bite:::::They killed me. They healed me. They changed me. Sure, the life of a graduate student wasn t exactly glamorous, but I was doing fine until Chicago s vampires announced their existence to the world. When a rogue vampire attacked me, I was lucky he only got a sip. Another bloodsucker scared him off and decided the best way to save my life was to make me the walking undead. Now I ve traded sweating over my thesis for learning to fit in at a Hyde Park mansion full of vamps loyal to Ethan Lord o the Manor Sullivan. Of course, as a tall, green-eyed, four-hundred-year-old vampire, he has centuries worth of charm, but unfortunately he expects my gratitude and servitude. Right But someone s out to get me. Is it the rogue vampire who bit me? A vamp from a rival House? An angry mob bearing torches? My initiation into Chicago s nightlife may be the first skirmish in a war and there will be blood.
